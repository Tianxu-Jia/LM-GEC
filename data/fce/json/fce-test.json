Beside the barbecue, there are some well-known student bands from our country are performing music through the whole night. What's more is, that there's a Latin music band coming to make the party more colourful. It plays from 10:00 to 11:00, while the students can enjoy it with dancing. The main events of the party will end up at about 12:30 in the night.

{"text": "To my personal opinion one of the most important and useful thing which has been invented in a car. Cars take a big part in our life. Everywhere you look you can see cars. More and more people learn how to drive and choose to travel by car, because it saves a lot of time comper to travelling by public transport. Cars are also more reliable than other types of transport. You don't have to wait on a bus stop on a cold and windy weather for a late bus, or being stuck on a train for an hour due to some railtrack repairs, you can just jump into a car, tune your radio onto your favourite station and have a plesant drive to your distanation.\n\nCars are even more important for emergency situations such as  fire in a house or if somebody is critically ill. Could you imagine if our police, doctors or fire-fighters had to get somewhere quickly on foot? I don't think I need to comment on this.\n\nFrom my personal experience I realised how it's important to drive a car when I was living in Johanesburg in South Africa. I arrived there with my family when my daughter was only 4 months old and I couldn't drive at that time. Johanesburg is a very dangerous place to live. I couldn't just go for a walk, it was too dangerous. There was no public transport and I had to stay in the complex where we lived most of the time, and relay on other people to take me to a shop or the doctors or anywhere else. There I soon realised that I had to learn how to drive if I wanted a quality  life for my daughter and myself.\n\nSince I passed my driving test I can not understand how I used to live without a car before.

Brief history of Po Lin Temple:\n\nIt was found in 1910. It is a traditional type of chinese temple. Because of the 2nd World War, it was re-built in 1960. A big Buhha was built in 1997 just next to the temple, which is the largest outdoor Buhha in the world.\n\n2. Location:\n\nThe location of Po Lin Temple is in Lotus Island, which is the second biggest island in Hong Kong.\n\n3.

Architecture\n\nThe architecture of the building in itself is really breathtaking in terms of luxury and ornamentation choice. Even if the architectural style may seem a bit 'heavy, this building is really a masterpiece with no similar comparison all over the world.\n\n2. Exposition\n\nAlthough I have to admit that it is very tiring to visit the whole museum in one day, it is such a rewarding and enriching time that people get never tired of looking at the paintings and sculptures of each section of the museum.\n\n3. Restaurant\n\nThe adjoining restaurant is very enjoyable as well. The waiters are friendly and always ready to give advice. In fact it is just what visitors need after their trip through the museum.\n\nTo sum up, I would say that this museum is more interesting than the other museums, because you can enjoy not only wonderful masterpieces but also a very uncommon architecture and a quiet restaurant  to have a rest if you need to.", "age": "21-25", "q": "2", "script-s": "39", "edits": [[0, [[235, 243, "", "UJ"], [411, 417, "", "UN"], [466, 467, "", "UP"], [520, 527, "real", "RJ"], [539, 547, "anywhere in", "R"], [698, 702, "experience", "RN"], [715, 724, "never get", "W"], [774, 776, "in", "RT"], [854, 863, "good", "RJ"], [1154, 1155, "", "UD"], [1161, 1169, "unusual", "RJ"], [1206, 1206, "where you will be able", "M"]]]], "l1": "fr", "id": "TE34*0100*2001*01", "answer-s": "5.1"}

The hotel is located in the centre of Seoul, therefore there  many ways to get to the conference. The easiest way to get there is to take the underground, which takes about 20 minutes. The map will be given to you on the day of your arrival.\n\nSecondly, the end-of-conference party will be held in the Palace Hotel's Percel Room and starts at 6 o'clock in the evening. Professor Kim from my college is going to give a speech, and after that dinner will be served. The party is not very formal, so you can wear any kind of dress, as long as it is suitable for dinner.\n\nFinally, I would like you to recommend the visit to a traditional Korean palace Kyong Bok for the last day's free time. It must be a very interesting visit for the students who has never experienced an oriental atmosphere. It is just 5 minutes walk from the hotel, and in front of the hotel gate, an airport bus will be waiting for you to take you to the airport after finishing the outing.\n\nI hope you will enjoy your stay in Korea, and do not hesitate to contact me for any further information.\n\nI look forward to seeing you soon,\n\nYours sincerely,", "age": "16-20", "q": "1", "script-s": "37", "edits": [[0, [[167, 179, "information", "CN"], [203, 203, "for", "MT"], [234, 237, "route", "RN"], [375, 375, "are", "MV"], [903, 906, "", "UA"], [1058, 1061, "have", "AGV"]]]], "l1": "ko", "id": "TE61*0100*2001*01", "answer-s": "5.2"}
{"text": ". Report on Kyoung Bok Palace - the Glory of Chosun Kingdom.\n\n. Introduction .\n\nThis report provides the information about Kyong Bok Palace, which is highly recommended to visit for visitors from foreign countries. It highlights the background history and considers the interest of young peoples, and makes a final recommendation.\n\n. History .\n\nThe kingdom Chosun has a history for 500 years and lasted until the beginning of  20th century. Kyong Bok Palace was the main residence of the royal family, so you will be able to imagine its size.\n\nAs the kings of Chosun loved to be a part of the nature, the palace had a huge garden, however it was destroyed by the army of Japan, and now there remains only a part of the original palace. There is a special monument for the last queen of Chosun who was killed by the Japanese army.\n\n. Activity .\n\nThe reason that this palace is also popular for the youngsters, who tends to dislike the historical visit, would be the various activity. You can try the traditional games of Korea and there is a chance to wear the traditional clothes of the Royals. Also there are performances which helds daily in the front gate of the palace.\n\n. Final Recommendation .\n\nIt is out of question not to visit Kyong Bok Palace unless you do not want to know about Korean history. You will find many interesting points there, therefore, I urge you to visit the place, if you want to experience the tradition of Korea.", "age": "16-20", "q": "2", "script-s": "37", "edits": [[0, [[169, 213, "for visitors from foreign countries to visit", "W"], [288, 295, "people", "IN"], [378, 381, "of", "RT"], [426, 426, "the", "MD"], [589, 592, "", "UD"], [663, 676, "Japanese army", "W"], [764, 767, "to", "RT"], [913, 918, "tend", "AGV"], [930, 933, "", "UD"], [945, 950, "visits", "FN"], [973, 981, "activities", "AGN"], [1129, 1134, "are held", "IV"], [1141, 1143, "at", "RT"], [1201, 1222, "It is out of the question", "ID"]]]], "l1": "ko", "id": "TE61*0100*2001*01", "answer-s": "5.1"}

{"text": "Can you see how many inventions you are surrounded with in your life? Such a simple and usuall things like a telefone, a car, a computer so only seem to be normal and usuall for us (or we have got used) as we use them every day.

They have intentions improved our life a lot since they had appeared, but not every one beleives it is really so.\n\nSome people say that many of important inventions in our live are not so good and useful as we have got used to see them. First of all they say about  enviroment pollution which cars and other vechicles make, overspending the electricity using electric equipment and some others .

I think the telefone is the most important thing in many people's lifes as it makes you to be able to get in touch with anyone  doesn't matter wherever you are (I am talking about mobile phones which now have a majority of our choice). Computers make everything much faster so everything is now based on computer systems. An electric lamp was an important invention  hundred years before (but for that time it was like a revolution).

Firstly, televisions make us know more about the world without travel it all. If there are no televisions, we won't know what are the other countries like, or even what language they speak unless we go to that country.\n\nSecondly, for some points, it can educate young children. Many TV programmes are especially made for children, such as \"Learn follow me\" and \"Be good to others\". Actually, they are quite good programmes and helped me know what I should do generally or how to behave nicely when I was still a child.\n\nThe last but not least, it is a good kind of entertainments. Maybe you will think that playing basketball, going to cinemas and discos are much better that staying at home sitting in front of an object. However, televisions can bring you the fun that other activities can't.

It is based on my own experience.\n\nWHY THE OLYMPIC MUSEUM.\n\nThe Olympique Museum is situated near the lake and offer, for the tourist, an unbelievable view on the mountains and the lake. But also, the museum have a lot of gardens with several statues. Besides, the architecture of the building is beautiful and very modern. First of all, the main interest of the museum is the olympic history. You can find a lot of documentary about it and you have several competitors personal objects. In addition, you can play with several interactive game and learn about the rules of the olympic games.\n\nREASONS OF RECOMMENDATION.\n\nThe principal reason is the cheapest price. You pay only to FRS for the entry and you can stay in all the time that you want. On the other hand, if you are more than 10 people, you can have a group price and pay only 6 Frs per person. It seems that this solution might be the best way to visit this museum.\n\nCONCLUSION.\n\nTo sum up, the Olympic Museum is a very attractive place and could be a good trip with your family or your student group.

You asked me which hotel the group had been booked . It is the Palace hotel, about a mile away  where the conference will take place.\n\nThe best way to get there, is to take the bus number 7. The bus stop is opposite the entrance of the hotel. You will leave the bus at ,,Royal gardens\". Turn left and go straight to ,,Baker street\" At the need of this street there is the house number 18. This is our college.\n\nYou wish to know all about ,,the end-of-conference party. As far as I can see there will be only a little dinner and a group of young singers will surprise us by their songs.\n\nMoreover you asked what to wear. Do not bother. I would recommend you wearing some casual clothes, like a jeans, a blouse or a skirt and a jacket. Donnot forget to wear a pair of comfortable shoes, because you will not have  chance to change it.\n\nFinally I give you some advise for what you could do for about three hours.\n\nFirstly we have a nice and interesting museum, it is located near the hotel.\n\nFurthemore there is the zoo with a lot of different animals, located to walk within five minutes.\n\nLastly there is also a very old and famous church, with many coloured windows.\n\nFor further information please call me up.

Be it: just for fun or also to discuss some important and relevant thins. Moreover we always can call for help to the police, to the hospital or to a doctor. This could save  life!\n\nAn other advantage is that all offices, firms and industries could not further exist without it.\n\nOf course there is also a big disadvantage.\n\nAll people know this situation; people want not to be interrupted, maybe they are reading a book, having a good talk or are having a little sleep... then the telephone rings...! It is not an easy desicion how to react now. Being sincere, most of us would go to the telephone.\n\nAnother point of disadvantage is that the mobile phones are ringing. everywhere and on every time.

{"text": "Report on the \"Paintings Museum\"\n\nIn order to write this report, I spent hours in this wonderful museum. There, I saw the exibitions and admired the building itself. I walked around the garden too.\n\nLocation\n\nThe museum is located in Ouchy, in front of the \"Delamuraz Hotel\". It is close to the main road, and at 300 meters of the station.\n\nOutside\n\nThe building is made of white stones. It has two floors. Before going inside, you have to pas through the huge garden. There, ponds, pools, trees, flowers and ducks can be admired. I recommend you to take your swim suit, because in summer, it is allowed to swim in  pools.\n\nInside\n\nWhen you are inside the museum, you will be impressed by the paintings on the walls. There were all painting during the war by nurses. If you go down a few steps, you will discover the ceilar. Everything in this room is about wine.\n\nTo learn the whole history of the building, there is a room dedicated to it on the first floor.\n\nI particularly recommend you to visit the \"blue\" room. Everything in this room is blue, the carpet, the ceiling and even the door.\n\nAccording to the owner, it was a room where in the past people used to go when they were depressed.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo sum up, I would like to add that this house is the most famous in our city. You should come and visit it for the paintings or for the building itself.\n\nYou won't be disappointed.\n\nThe only negative point is that you have to pay 10 francs to visit. the house and the garden.", "age": "26-30", "q": "2", "script-s": "34", "edits": [[0, [[122, 132, "exhibitions", "S"], [241, 252, "opposite", "RT"], [310, 312, "", "UT"], [317, 323, "metres", "SA"], [324, 326, "from", "RT"], [440, 443, "pass", "SX"], [560, 569, "swimsuit", "RP"], [615, 615, "the", "MD"], [717, 722, "They", "AGA"], [732, 740, "painted", "TV"], [817, 823, "cellar", "S"], [852, 857, "connected with", "RT"], [1456, 1457, "", "UP"]]]], "l1": "fr", "id": "TE97*0100*2001*01", "answer-s": "4.3"}
