{"text": "13th June 2000\n\nDear Ms Helen Ryan\n\nCompetition Organiser\n\nI have just recieved the letter, which lets me know that I have won the first prize. I am proud of winning it and would like to say how thankful I am. I am therefore writing to give you my further information.\n\nFirst of all, I am a student and would like to travel in July. Because I intend to take  examination in Septenber. So I can afford to go on holiday only in July. Secondly, I would prefer to stay at log cabins rather than tents. It will be my first time to experience to stay there and I am interested in trying new things which I have not tried.\n\nThe next consideration is the activities. Actually, I used to play basketball for 6 years and am quite confident of it. And nowadays, I have been practicing tennis as  school activity. Therefore I would like to choose basketball and tennis.\n\nFinally, I am considering about what kind of clothes I should wear and how much I need. I would be most grateful if you could give me further advicable information.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you.\n\nYours sincerely,", "age": "26-30", "q": "1", "script-s": "27", "edits": [[0, [[71, 79, "received", "S"], [195, 203, "grateful", "RJ"], [333, 340, "This is because", "M"], [358, 358, "an", "MD"], [374, 383, "September", "S"], [465, 467, "in", "RT"], [523, 536, "experiencing", "FV"], [537, 544, "staying", "FV"], [730, 732, "at", "RT"], [741, 749, "recently", "RY"], [763, 773, "practising", "SA"], [784, 784, "a", "MD"], [873, 884, "wondering", "RV"], [1001, 1010, null, "DJ"]]]], "l1": "ja", "id": "TR27*0100*2000*01", "answer-s": "4.3"}

So I'm now writing to let you know how grateful it was. All  work I needed to do wasn't very interesting. which I must have set thousands  chairs correctly and after finishing I put them back nicely. The reason I enjoyed it very much is that I could meet the vocalist on setting chairs just before they started practicing. I was asked if I wanted to sit down in front of  stage. Naturally I agreed and I could enjoy their gig as  audience. It was absolutely fantastic. I had ever never sit down there. Additionally, you couldn't believe , but the vocalist said \"All the chairs you are sitting down  were set  from him,\" pointing at me!! Actually I was a bit ashamed but it will be my brilliant memory.\n\nAnyway it was so interesting  time that I didn't even feel tired after that. Finally, I suggest you should try as I did if you have any opportunity. You must like it.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing you soon.

Surprisily, there were no discounds.\n\nSecondly, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30, it's a theatre but not a concert hall!!!!\n\nThirdly, we were astonished about the actors whose we know from others musical. Why did you not change the name of your advertisement?\n\nIn the end, the restaurant was closed because you didn't have enough staffs, this evening!! Nothing was serious. We really like London, the people, the night-life but this evening was really awful.\n\nI sent to you a copie of our tickets. Would you pleased return our money back.

{"text": "13th June, 2000\n\nShopping is not always enjoyable.\n\nI think this topic is so exciting in the antropological and psicological point of view, because we can studie the  reaction before, during and after to shopping.\n\nPeople in general have a compulsory actitud for shopping in my opinion. Because sometimes the article for to buy is not really necessary. We must to accept that  media have so important effect in our life in special the T.V.\n\nFor the men and women is important the appearance and they spent a lot of money in buy clothes, cosmetic, accesories, jewels etc. And the other  they choose sometimes just for the label. Without give really importance to the calidad in reference to the appearance there is more preocupation in the food area, because people in general they don't spent the time for prepare food and when they  shopping they choose pre-prepared food.

In addition we would like to thank you about the programme.\n\nFirstly, I would like to give you some details about this show. It will take place in  Central Exhibition Hall, in London, on Tuesday  14th of March and the suitable time will be 10.00 - 19.00\n\nI would like to mention that  this day we are going to visit the Science Museum in the morning and after we are going for shopping, so I believe it will be a good change for all of us to attend this show as it is free for students! The most important thing is that the time that the show starts is perfect and is suitable as well with our programme because until 19:00 I think that everyone will have finished their shopping.\n\nSecondly, I would like to give you more details about the show and particularly  what does it include. The latest fashion will be on show and also the Leisure and sports wear. Really interesting! Moreover all about the make up and the hairstyles. I think that it will be a great opportunity to all of us to be on this show while we are going to be in London. But, if there is a problem that the show is on Tuesday afternoon, the same hour with shopping, I suggest having the shopping on Wednesday afternoon that we will not have anything to do!\n\nI look forward to your reply,\n\nYours sincerely,", "age": "21-25", "q": "1", "script-s": "23", "edits": [[0, [[126, 127, "", "UP"], [173, 173, "in", "MT"], [174, 180, "", "UY"], [221, 226, "for", "RT"], [329, 329, "the", "MD"], [377, 377, "the", "MD"], [396, 413, null, "R"], [466, 466, "on", "MT"], [555, 558, "", "UT"], [600, 606, "chance", "RN"], [750, 758, "compatible", "RJ"], [794, 799, "by", "RT"], [944, 944, "about", "MT"], [950, 954, "", "UV"], [958, 965, "includes", "AGV"], [978, 985, "fashions", "FN"], [1069, 1109, null, "R"], [1124, 1186, "this show will be a great opportunity for all of us", "AS"], [1200, 1211, "", "UV"], [1226, 1227, "", "UP"], [1250, 1254, "because", "RC"], [1298, 1302, "time", "RN"], [1303, 1307, "as", "RT"], [1308, 1316, "our shopping trip", "M"], [1328, 1334, "going", "RV"], [1335, 1338, "", "UD"], [1371, 1375, "when", "RC"]]]], "l1": "el", "id": "TR230*0100*2000*02", "answer-s": "2.3T"}
{"text": "Some people think that to be a famous person is  very excuiting thing, that all the time this makes you feel completely and also they think that if you are famous you are special as well.\n\nI believe, that if somebody wants the fame and the glory  must be tottally sure about the results. For example, the politicians the have choosed their careers, they must know that they are going to involved with everything that it has to do with publicity and their country and the most important  is that they have to realize that they should be extremely careful of their movements or else they are going to have  bad reputation, and they will be not  trustworthy.\n\nAnother succesfull carreer such as, film stars must also be balanced. If somebody is a film star this mean that  has got a different kind of life,  more comfortable, more interesting  but it doesn't mean that he or she can't be like normal people even if he or she is a star.\n\nIf somebody wants to be famous of cource  must be on the top and the mass media will be following him or her. But I think that the are limits. Everybody deserve to have a private life even if he is a plumber or even if she is a famous singer. It doesn't matter what kind of carreer or job you are follow. You must control your behaviour and try not implove so much yourself.

The advertisement says that the show is full of many interesting programmes, such as the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles etc.  Moreover, students are allowed to admit for free.\n\nAll of us would like to attend the show because young people, particularly girls are interested in fashion and make up, so we are expecting the show will be the great opportunity to see what the new trend in fashion will be like.

{"text": "Technical and Warm Home People's way of life has considerably been changed by rapdily developing mordern technology.  To begin with, it will be good to look back on how our parents have lived in a house. 50 years ago, Korean mothers should have made a fire by burning woods to warm a room up and make food.  Since the eletric fire and microwave oven had been invented, their life have been far easier than before. Today, however, people do not need to spend many times on making food, washing up, or even on turning on an off the light.  Machines, such as a dish washer, laundry machine and remote controller help us jut to relax or do a little work necessary. From my point of view, people's home in the future will be controlled by a computer which is devised in every machine, TV, cooker and the light, connecting to the owner.  He/she can just press the button or send e-mail to operate what he/she needs, even though the owner is far from the house. On the other hand, people will still be living in a building which is constructed for a \"family\".

THEY CAN SAY ,,SHOPPING IS NOT ENJOYABLE'' BECAUSE THEY PREFER TO ORDER CLOTHES AND FOOD IN CATALOGUES OR IN THE PIZZA HUT RESTAURANT SITUATED ON THE CORNER. THEY ARE TOO LAZY FOR WALKING AND LOOKING FOR SOMETHING NICE FOR  BIRTHDAY PRESENT OR FLOWERS FOR GIRL-FRIENDS. ON THE OTHER HAND - IT'S VERY COMFORTABLE TO SEAT AT HOME, CALL AND WAIT FOR THE ORDER REALISATION. PEOPLE, WHO DON'T LIKE SHOPPING HAVE THEIR OWN REASONS OF THIS SITUATIONS (MAYBE THEY HAD AN ACCIDENT WITH A RUDE SHOP-ASSISTANCE, BOUGHT NOT FRESH FOOD ONE DAY AND DO NOT WANT TO DO THAT ANY MORE, HAD  BAD EXPERIENCE WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN SHOPS). THEY DON'T LIKE SHOPPING EITHER BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER (SOMETIMES IT'S TOO HOT OR TOO COLD FOR GOING OUTSIDE).\n\nANYHOW EVERYBODY SHOUD DO SHOPPING AS PEOPLE NEED TO EAT, NEED CLOTHES AND MANY OTHER IMPORTANT THINGS TO LIVE. EVEN IF THE SHOPPING IS NOT ALWAYS ENJOYABLE PEOPLE HAVE TO BUY THINGS (AND SPEND MONEY).\n\nBUT EVERY INDIVIDUAL CAN CHOOSE THE WAY HOW TO DO IT. IT ABSOLUTELY DEPENDS ON A LIFE-STYLE, PERSONALITY AND NEEDS.", "age": "26-30", "q": "3", "script-s": "27", "edits": [[0, [[63, 73, "ESPECIALLY", "S"], [204, 216, "HYPERMARKETS", "S"], [283, 289, "MOTORBIKES", "RN"], [372, 380, "FAMILY", "FN"], [739, 741, "FROM", "RT"], [873, 873, "A", "MD"], [906, 918, "GIRLFRIENDS", "UP"], [965, 969, "SIT", "RV"], [1007, 1018, "", "UN"], [1026, 1027, "", "UP"], [1075, 1077, "FOR", "RT"], [1083, 1093, "SITUATION", "AGN"], [1134, 1149, "SHOP ASSISTANT", "DN"], [1222, 1222, "A", "MD"], [1379, 1385, "ANYWAY", "L"], [1396, 1401, "SHOULD", "S"], [1622, 1625, "", "UY"], [1661, 1662, "", "UD"], [1663, 1673, "LIFESTYLE", "UP"]]]], "l1": "pl", "id": "TR669*0100*2000*01", "answer-s": "3.3"}

Is it very hot? What kind of clothes should I bring with me?\n\nAnd what about money? How much money Should I take with me? Are there any activities which are not included?

We used to tell everything to each other. I was having some family problems, so my marks were getting down and down. Pat was worried, she didn't know what to do. One day she looked me in the eyes with a sharp deep look, Never have I seen such a deep look: and asked me what was happening and I told her as I always used to. That afternoon she visited me and told me a plan she had designed to make my marks rise. It consisted in stealing the school list from the computer, in other words, hack  the school software.\n\nI thought it was a great idea, so I stole about ten tests we were planned to do.\n\nPat couldn't stand the pressure of the \"crime\" so she told the school directors that I stole the tests.
