But I prefer realistic stories such as Ernest Hemingway's \"The Old Man and the Sea'.\n\nAbove all, realistic stories teach me something of the life, or at least influence me. As far as I'm concerned, my behaviour and attitudes towards a difficult situation began to change after reading this book. Here, the fishman is very old, but he is still challenging to everything he faces. When he caught a shark which was bigger than the ship, he never gave up  taking it back to his village, even when sharks were around him. Real stories have huge impacts on me, and affect me a lot, often in good ways.\n\nIn addition to that, realistic stories are more attractive, I personally don't want to hear stories about very peculiar incidents as I know they cannot be true. But, while reading realistic stories, I just fall deep into the story, into the writer's own world. Ernest Hemingway's sentences are precise, but still very powerful and alive. So when I read  other sharks eating the shark the old man had caught, I got very angry and annoyed. Realistic stories thus, develop our imagination and creativity, which are essential in our lives.\n\nWe all learn from reading books, but realistic stories have more influence on me and develop my personality.

I found it was a very good idea. However, there are a few things that I personally think can be improved in the following editions.\n\nFirst of all, because of the advertisement I expected starts and artists from all over the world but they came from only six countries. Artists from different cultures may make the festival even more interesting.\n\nSecondly, although the music concerts were good, I think that some concert halls were too small. It was a shame to found that some of them were sold out because  the short number of seats available. However, I really enjoyed the dance shows and the plays and films. I suggest it can be a good idea to set more projections next year.

The livingroom won't get any big changes although the televisions, stereos and videos will become more modern and perhaps more difficult.\n\nIn general we can say the huge change we already had, but who knows exactly what the future will bring to us?\n\nLet's have a surprise?", "age": "26-30", "q": "3", "script-s": "32", "edits": [[0, [[108, 109, "", "UD"], [110, 116, "changes", "FN"], [130, 130, ",", "MP"], [148, 152, "to", "RT"], [177, 180, "", "UD"], [181, 185, "homes", "FN"], [186, 186, "then", "MY"], [200, 200, ",", "MP"], [218, 220, "they", "AGA"], [221, 224, "have", "AGV"], [260, 270, "equipment", "RN"], [297, 307, "living room", "RP"], [310, 312, "In", "RP"], [327, 335, "is possible", "R"], [345, 350, "won't", "TV"], [382, 384, "", "UT"], [385, 389, "yourself", "SX"], [390, 393, "", "UA"], [407, 416, "will just have", "TV"], [466, 466, "off", "MY"], [487, 487, ",", "MP"], [506, 514, "robots", "DN"], [538, 540, "to", "RT"], [574, 574, "and", "MC"], [593, 593, ".", "MP"], [594, 603, "Maybe", "UC"], [609, 617, "will also be", "TV"], [623, 629, "life", "RN"], [630, 637, "partners", "S"], [696, 706, "living room", "RP"], [713, 716, "see", "RV"], [732, 732, ",", "MP"], [742, 745, "", "UD"], [819, 828, "complicated", "RJ"], [849, 852, "see", "RV"], [862, 868, "changes", "FN"], [872, 883, "have already had", "TV"], [934, 936, "for", "RT"], [963, 964, ".", "RP"]]]], "l1": "de", "id": "TR70*0100*2000*02", "answer-s": "4.1"}

Can you imagine, I could stay at this concert without paying anything! And I managed to speak to Ricky Martin out of stage.

Furthermore, it's  worthful experience for people  to know  the other countries' arts.\n\nBut I would like to suggest some requests for the festival.\n\nFirstly, it is better to invite more artists not only from six countries. For example, the artists or stars from we have rare chance to feel the atmosphere.\n\nSecondly, some concert halls were too small to enter all of the audience. Moreover, plays and films were shown only twice a day so that people had gathered one time. I would prefer to be held more performances next year in the bigger halls.\n\nFinally, regards to tickets, it is  very wonderful idea because it is more combinient to enjoy the festival for one day among a lot of people.\n\nYou may consider my suggestion to have the art festival for next year.\n\nYours Sincerely", "age": "31-40", "q": "1", "script-s": "23", "edits": [[0, [[130, 130, "with", "MT"], [147, 149, "at", "RT"], [172, 185, "organized", "TV"], [205, 205, "a", "MD"], [206, 214, "worthwhile", "DJ"], [237, 237, "who want", "M"], [246, 246, "about", "MT"], [247, 250, "", "UD"], [295, 302, "make", "RV"], [317, 320, "regarding", "RT"], [348, 350, "would be", "TV"], [381, 408, null, "R"], [423, 491, null, "R"], [541, 546, "contain", "RV"], [637, 658, null, "R"], [668, 674, "like", "RV"], [675, 703, "more performances to be held", "W"], [745, 755, "with regard to", "DT"], [771, 771, "a", "MD"], [772, 776, "really", "RY"], [811, 821, "convenient", "S"], [880, 949, null, "R"]]]], "l1": "ja", "id": "TR83*0102*2000*02", "answer-s": "2.3"}

However I would like to give my opinion about the festival.\n\nFirst of all, I congratulate you on making this kind of event. It was such a good success that some people weren't able to have tickets! You should increase the number of places you give.

If I don't make the cooking, I will have to do the washing up. I am sometimes allowed to watch the television when I have finished my homeworks.\n\nFortunately I can play  violin when I want even if I haven't done my homework.

It's good to walk around looking  all the news in the stores.\n\nBut, sometimes, go shopping can have other effects on you. It can stress you. For example, when the place is crowded and noisy and you can't even move easily to look around. When you can't find what you are looking for anywhere. When you buy something you were looking for a long time and, when you arrive at home, you discover some deffect on it and have to go back to the store to complain.

She is fond of the actor Danny Brook so I decided to buy two tickets, provided there were discounts available. When we asked for discounts tickets, we were said there never were discount offers and that we had to pay  the highest tickets - £20 each - because we were not English students. We were annoyed about it but we paid off. We took our places, and began chatting with other people. We had to wait  8.15 pm before it started whereas the show was supposed to start at 9.30 pm!

{"text": "Your children clothes in 100 years\n\nHow interesting it is to imagine what kind of clothes people will wear in about a hundred years from now. Fashion is changing so quickly that all our dreams about clothes can become true. But let's see my point of view. In a hundred years,  clothes would certainly be totally differents than ours. Materials, textures and colours change, and are minds too.\n\nSo I think people will wear clothes made of recycled things, like bottles of aluminium. And I hope colours won't be dark and sad but very bright and enjoyable to see.\n\nI think men will still wear pants and jackets but maybe not in jeans. Syntethic materials have grown up and become very popular so it would keep going on. But maybe the shape of the clothes will changed: large pants as \"baggy\", or trousers with many pockets as we see today. For women, clothes change more than for men's. It maybe because they are more likely to try new ways of clothes. I guess they will wear a sort of tunique upon a shirt and a skirt, or more male clothes because they want to change. Finally it's very difficult to say that .\n\nMaybe Luc Besson's \"Fifth Element\" movie is quite a good example. The clothes were designed by the famous Jean-Paul Gaultier. And it really is an interesting point of view.\n\nTo conclude, in the end clothes won't be what we think about today, and it's a good thing because we can only imagine and follow the trend of fashion that makes us feel pretty and happy.", "age": "16-20", "q": "3", "script-s": "36", "edits": [[0, [[5, 13, "children's", "MP"], [211, 217, "come", "RV"], [276, 276, "the", "MD"], [285, 290, "will", "TV"], [312, 322, "different", "IJ"], [323, 327, "from", "R"], [378, 381, "our", "R"], [460, 480, "aluminium bottles", "W"], [622, 624, "", "UT"], [632, 641, "Synthetic", "S"], [657, 665, "developed", "RV"], [693, 695, "they", "AGA"], [713, 715, "", "UT"], [757, 764, "change", "TV"], [772, 788, "\"baggy\" pants", "W"], [877, 882, "men", "UP"], [941, 948, "dressing", "R"], [983, 990, "tunic", "S"], [991, 995, "over", "RT"], [1025, 1029, "masculine", "RJ"], [1102, 1106, "what", "RA"], [1107, 1107, null, "M"], [1129, 1150, "movie \"Fifth Element\"", "W"], [1339, 1344, "they will be", "R"]]]], "l1": "fr", "id": "TR112*0102*2000*01", "answer-s": "5.1"}

{"text": "Although human is a social creature, all people need an area  to be able to stay away from other people. This is essential to renew the energy which is necessary for daily life. Also we all like to have some special things and people in our lives to help us to feel different from others. It can be a lover, a hobby or a habit.\n\nThinking about famous people, we generally tend to ignore this need. I believe this feeling sources from a strange though; when somebody gets famous, whatever the job is they do, we think we have some kind of right over them. Consequently we demand to know every single detail about them and their lives.

However, 15% thougth that it was not a good idea because it would be boring to see other people enjoying  and they mentioned it as not really important.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs you can see, my clasemates and almost everybody in the school are happy with the facilities and activities that we have.

Next, it can be very good for your wallet to save some money, when you will find a bargain or sales. As well as that, some shop-assistance can give you a lower price, because you always do shopping at their shop. What is more, most people cannot live without shopping. It is their way to spend free time.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some minuses. On top of that, shopping is very tiring and exhausting. Walking from shop to shop carrying heavy bags, takes much of your time. Instead of that you could do more interesting things. such as playing sports or reading a book. Besides that, shopping steal you from money. Very often people go to a shop - usually a big departament store and buy things which they do not need.\n\nIn my opinion shopping is very tiring and I usually try to avoid doing it.

{"text": "The aim of this report is to give some suggestions about the short video which my college is going to make about the daily life of our school. It considers two points: the lessons and  activities which should be filmed.\n\nI am of the opinion that the morning English lessons with our teacher George are worth filming and showing for many reasons. Above all, they are enjoyable and interesting. All of us participate effectively. Nobody is yawning or feeling bored. I want this opinion won't imply that the other lessons of other teachers aren't interesting. I think we are lucky with our competent teachers. Besides the practical lessons of the cooking course level NVQ3 might be interesting with the delicious dishes of meat and vegetables. The pictures will be amazing and wonderful.\n\nThere are many activities that they could be filmed. We can film our Swimming pool, despite the artificial sunbathing. It is clean, neat and tidy with helpful staff. The gym is  good choice for filming with the sophisticated equipments that  owns. In addition, we can film the library which possesses thousand of works. Books of various interest, with up-to-date facilities such as computers  internet, CD and cassettes.\n\nWe shouldn't disregard and neglect to film the buildings and the gardens of our beautiful college, especially when we take into our consideration the fact that it is in the city of Shakespear. It will be a good advertising, and will help to make the reputation of our college even more better.\n\nFinally, I hope that my modest report will help the management of our college to achieve their aim.", "age": "31-40", "q": "2", "script-s": "32", "edits": [[0, [[160, 166, "areas", "RN"], [184, 184, "the", "MD"], [290, 290, ",", "MP"], [297, 297, ",", "MP"], [415, 426, null, "RY"], [466, 495, null, "R"], [607, 614, "Also", "RY"], [696, 699, "their", "RD"], [754, 758, "would", "TV"], [817, 821, "", "UA"], [870, 903, null, "R"], [963, 963, "a", "MD"], [1011, 1021, "equipment", "CN"], [1027, 1027, "you", "MA"], [1028, 1032, "have", "RV"], [1070, 1070, ",", "MP"], [1104, 1111, ", books", "RP"], [1112, 1114, "on", "RT"], [1123, 1131, "subjects", "FN"], [1177, 1177, ",", "MP"], [1178, 1178, "the", "MD"], [1179, 1187, "Internet", "RP"], [1189, 1191, "CDs", "FN"], [1221, 1230, null, "RV"], [1318, 1322, "if", "RC"], [1336, 1339, "", "UD"], [1389, 1399, "Shakespeare", "S"], [1412, 1413, "", "UD"], [1489, 1493, "", "UY"]]]], "l1": "el", "id": "TR145*0100*2000*01", "answer-s": "5.1"}

{"text": "\"Wuthering Heights\" by Emile Brönte I think this statement is a very truly afimation in the case of my book because the main character of the story is a very wicked man.

It's the richest character at all, his name is Heathcliff, and he's the reason of whatever happens to the others characters. They are always suffering  the revenge that Heathcliff  swear,  cause of which is the miserable situation the other character have put him in. From this point of view I think Heathcliff shouldn't be hated by his bad temper. He's not good not because he was born with this trend to harm but  the others character make him become thus.

If it is something they like, they always have to try it on. We all know how it is when a woman tried on some clothes (usually several ) but it's still better than when we're talking about shoes! That has to be the worst. Seeing or imagining a woman in the cloths she chooses can at least help when  being bored, but shoes are just shoes. Shopping for them is a very long and tiring experiance.

Dancers worn nice clothes,  the music was very good. Unfortunately there were no Spanish dancers. I prefere them to others. Maybe next year? You should invite artists from more countries. We also listened to the concerts but in our opinion the concert halls were too small. During the jazz and rock concerts the audience wants to play and dance so it needs more room. I like listening to the classical music in the big halls, too. My boyfriend was exciting about the art exhibitions and listening to the writers.

{"text": "Dear Karrie,\n\nHello. How are you doing? I've been also considering rules at home with my friends. Isn't it quite interesting to talk about rules? At home I'm not allowed to talk on the phone more than ten minutes, which annoys me very much. I really want to change this. However, I can go out wheneve I want, even in the mid-night. I'm also allowed to come home anytime so that I can chat with my friends for a long time instead of talking on the phone at home.\n\nThere is a lot of rules at my school. Firstly, we're allowed to drive a car to school, which is quite  unusual rule in  Japanese school because students might crash a car on the way to school or home.

It gives an opportunity to get acquainted with the cultures' variety of the whole world. However, at this festival there were artists only from six countries. Whereas an advertisement promised stars from around the world.\n\nDespite that, all the jazz, rock and classical concerts were extremely enjoyable. Although, some concert halls were too small for all the guests of the festival.\n\nAnother disadvatage of the festival's programme was  lack of plays and films which are the best  to display the modern county's culture. I suppose. I hope there will be more of them next year.\n\nI must also admit the organization of the festival was perfect. All the guests were offered a weekend ticket for all events. That was an excellent decision as all the events started at different time and there was plenty of them. In addition, it was reasonable-priced.\n\nIn conclusuon, I would like to say that in spite of the success of the festival some improvements still can be done. For example, the next year's one may last not for two days only, but for a week. So it will be available for  greater amount of people.\n\nThe programme can be also improved by adding new categories such as folk songs.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\nSincerely yours,", "age": "16-20", "q": "1", "script-s": "30", "edits": [[0, [[112, 119, "attended", "RV"], [244, 253, "cultural", "DJ"], [327, 336, "from only", "W"], [350, 359, ", whereas", "RP"], [360, 362, "the", "RD"], [496, 507, ", although", "RP"], [587, 598, "disadvantage", "S"], [631, 631, "the", "MD"], [675, 675, null, "MN"], [687, 690, "a", "RD"], [698, 706, "country's", "RN"], [714, 715, ",", "RP"], [718, 725, "think", "RV"], [968, 972, "times", "FN"], [983, 986, "were", "AGV"], [1023, 1040, "reasonably-priced", "DY"], [1046, 1056, "conclusion", "S"], [1154, 1158, "made", "RV"], [1173, 1176, "", "UD"], [1193, 1196, "could", "RV"], [1269, 1269, "a", "MD"], [1278, 1284, "number", "RN"], [1311, 1314, "could", "TV"], [1315, 1322, "also be", "W"]]]], "l1": "ru", "id": "TR187*0102*2000*02", "answer-s": "4.1"}

I like taking pictures and want to share my interest with the others. I am not a photographer but my family think that my photos are more then just good.\n\nFinally I want to ask you some questions.

{"text": "Shopping is not always enjoyable.\n\nMy best friend is crazy about shopping. She will prefer shopping to everything else. She thinks that it is the most pleasant  spending of time, when you going from one shop to another, watching other people, looking at beautiful clothes, getting some fashionable ideas. Somitimes I feel very sorry for her. It seems that going shopping is a sense of living. And it's so many people like her. Lots of families planing a day out to go to a shopping center, and it is a normal routine for them - to spent the all day just shopping. Not so many people thinking about going fishing or playing sport games with their families any more. They forgot how beautiful could be the countryside, and only tourists you can meet in the castles or museums.\n\nPeople are normally angry after shopping - because it is so easy to get tied. People are not smiling to each other, not talking to each other at the shops. They look like a robotes who have to do their duties - to buy.\n\nIn my opinion shopping is just  to cover our basic needs. Shops are not for spending our lifes in them. Try to give up shopping one day and try to spend your day with friends going to play something together. It feels much more better.

In your advert for the musical show you promised the newest and best musical show, but it wasn't. First I was very disappointed about the price of the ticket because I expected to pay a smaller pice than £20 for my six year old daughter. Then the show already started at 20:15 and not at 19:30! I was quite bored, sitting in my chair and waiting for the beginning of the show.\n\nFor me the most disappointing problem was that the starring Danny Brook wasn't there. My husband was also looking forward to seeing Mr. Brook as an actor of your musical because he is one of his greatest fans. The actor which acted instead of Danny Brook wasn't as good as Mr. Brook.\n\nAfter the show, which wasn't really the best I have ever seen, my family and I wanted to get some snacks in the theatre restaurant.

When I visited the festival, of course, it was really good.\n\nI was impressed of the idea of the festival. I could enjoy different culture and also I could expand my knowledge. Moreover, the weekend ticket was fantastic because I spent two days  the festival - Saturday and Sunday. The ticket price was not too expensive for  student too.\n\nHowever, you said \"Stars and artists from around the world\" in the advertisement. But there were only six countries' candidates. It was exaggerated. Besides, some concert halls were too small. Jazz and classical concerts' halls were especially small. It caused a long queue and I had to waste my time. Except  these two things, it was quite good.\n\nI'd like to suggest this - concerned with plays and films. Plays and films qualities were good, but quantities were bad. In addition, most of the people in the festival liked that. In my opinion, you have to run more plays and films in next year's festival.\n\nI'm looking forward to hearing your answer.\n\nYours sincerely,", "age": "16-20", "q": "1", "script-s": "27", "edits": [[0, [[342, 344, "with", "RT"], [395, 402, "cultures", "FN"], [509, 509, "at", "MT"], [589, 589, "a", "MD"], [816, 825, "concert", "UP"], [913, 913, "for", "MT"], [979, 993, "concerning", "RT"], [1027, 1036, "", "UN"], [1048, 1071, "there weren't enough", "R"]]]], "l1": "ko", "id": "TR199*0102*2000*02", "answer-s": "3.2"}
{"text": "I'd like to tell you about my experiences. Before that you have to think  why you need to earn money and how you do that. It is really important because making money needs a proper purpose.\n\nFirstly, I did newspaper delivery. I could make a bit of money, of course, it was far much than pocket money. Nevertheless, I lost my concerntration to the study and I spent the money to entertainment. I earned easily and I couldn't control myself at that time. I was only 12 years old.\n\nSecondly, I made  brochure for a company when I was in high school. I was studying computer at that time. Also I was leader of the computer user circle in the school so I needed some money for managing the circle. For this reason, I took this kind of part-time job in the company. Despite the fact that it was  part-time job, I worked very hard because I liked computer works. I could earn money,  also I got a career.\n\nFinally, I worked for a factory during the last winter holiday. It was also hard and difficult, but I think that was  easy way to make money. I forgot many skills and knowledge during the time. So  lose was bigger than  profit.\n\nIn conclusion, if you want to earn a bit of money, then you have to choose  proper part-time job. Because you will get some money as well as some career and knowledge. You must consider the purpose too.

It was excellent about one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events, because it is convenient and normally young people do not have a lot of money, so I hope next year the ticket will be also like this.\n\nI hope that you can consider my suggestions.

{"text": "17/6/00\n\nDear Sir/Madam\n\nI had a vary dissappointing evining last saturday. I had everythig planned, I and my family where coming to whatch your show and then have a decent meal at your theatre restaurant but it was disasterous. Firstly there was no available discount, as you said  on your advertisement so even my 6 year old son was charged  adult price. Then everything was going well untill the show didn't start! Supposedly it was to start at 19:30 well it didn't, it started 45 minutes late, at exactly 20:15. And By the way may I ask you how up to date your leaflets are because in spite of the ad vert saying the staring actor was Danny Brook, well it wasn't. It was an other actor  I had never heard of. That was a dissapointment for my whole family, infact all the viewers where very dissappointed.\n\nAnyway the show was nowhere as good as it was mentioned to be and it was definately worse than I had expected it to be, I didn't enjoy it at all so I was relying on the food to fill me up and relieve some of my stress. So as soon as the show was over we walked out and followed all the signs for about 5 minutes desparately searching for your restaurants our stomaches rumbling for food. Finally we found the place. The location is far too far away and, what do you know, the place is closed for restoration, and it has been for two weeks! And your booking staff didn't know this obviously as they took our booking, with no problems whatsoever. they even gave us a table number.\n\nWhat kind of an organasation do you call this, sir/madam? You don't understand how dissappointed and angry I was that night. I was expecting a perfect night out but I came face to face with a total nightmare. And I am demanding a refund.\n\nThankyou for your time and attention\n\nYours Sincerely.

In fact he was one of the main busybodies of his neighborhood and his school so not alot of people in his school liked him. this was a vary bad thing about Pat's school and also for Pat. Another bad thing about this school was that there where different types of students that formed groups. Some where just friend groups but others took it seriously, maby just a bit too seriously, they gave themselves names and acted as gangs rather than just groups of friends, and started picking on younger people, or mempers of other gang, trying to start fights with them. This whent on and on, got more and more serious but it was so secret that  teachers didn't notice.\n\nOne day one of those groups decided to have a party and although Pat wasn't in their group they invited him too but told him very strictly to keep it a secret especially from the other groups. But Pat was so exited that he forgot all about the secret and told all of his best mates. and the word spread like wildfire and by the end of the day virtually everyone knew about this party. But luckily for Pat the word did not return to the group having the party. Everyone in the year was anoyed, but not with Pat, oh, no! With the group having the party. No one could do anything about it. exept a few phcyco groups, some of the more serious ones decided to raid this party, just for the fun and meannes of it.\n\nThat night the party commenced. Everyone was enjoying themselves exept Pat who had heard about the raid. So he was thinking up an excuse to go home early. But no excuses where working.

Did you like it more than the previous one?\n\nI must say that our school rules are quite different than yours. First of all we have to stand up, when we speak to the teacher and have to pay full attention to the lessons. If you missed a lesson, that could be a trouble for yourself. I think it depends on the school. Privat schools have  more relaxed atmosphere that the state school. They don't have strike rules and students can take extra lessons.\n\nOn the other hand, in the state schools as I said, we are more respectful to the teacher and bad behaviours are punished. For example, you have to do more homeworks or they are sending you home etc. Of course smoking isn't allowed at any part of the schol.\n\nI have a relaxed family and we are sharing all the houseworks. My Father does the cooking, my mother does the cleaning and I do tidying up! But in many Families women are doing more than men.

We know it does not matter  they are famous or not, everyone has his own privacy. However, as human beings, almost all of us are curious. We like to know and chat about gossip. This is why gossip magazines are so popular. Due to commercial value, journalists have to follow them all the time to peep  their private lives to satisfy us. There, it is impossible for journalists to stop chasing them.\n\nHowever, journalists should not only think about commercial value, but morality and priciples are also being concerned. Of course, it everyone pays less attention or interest, the situations should be better.

It's an exhibition of fashions, sport wears, make up and hairstyles. We think it is a great opportunity because there are some people in our class who like to study fashions after leaving this school. And everyone of us is interested in fashions and clothes! This exhibition is situated in  Central Exhibition Hall, London.\n\nWe've noticed that the exhibition will be on Tuesday,  14th of March. Could we change our programme?

In your letter, you asked me wheter the book I've read would be a suitable present for your cousin's fifteenth birthday. It's my pleasure to write my suggestion for you now!\n\nYou know I love reading books, it's my passion. I've read all the books of  English author Ernest Hemingway. They are great I tell you! But I think your cousin is too young for it. Why? Because he especially concentrates on  history, social life and politic situation in the time the story is played. That might be quiet complicated to understand, especially for young people. For me, his books are great. But anyway, do you know the book with the title 'The Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie'? It's written by Agatha Christie. She's an American and her books concentrate on crime and detective stories. Her books aren't difficult to understand. She especially write books for young people. And I think this book is a very good one for your cousin. You wrote that your cousin is quite intered in magic, detectives and sport, didn't you? I think this is the best choice for him!\n\nI've send you a copy of the summary from the book and an interesting article about the author and the book. Please read it and write your comments.

I suggest to you that you should organise more next year.\n\nOn the other hand, there were a lot that impressed me very much. For example, there was one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events.

When we need to go upstairs, you have to keep left and when you have to go downstairs, you need to keep left as well. You have to do your homework and do your best  what you're asked to do. You can't go to the toilet during the class, because you are interrupting the other student's study and there are more.. like when the class starts you have to keep quiet and you can't say anything while the teacher speaks. Second, at home we all have different rules. Some family have rules that you have to put spoons and dishes everyday.

You should wear the same things every time, no changes and alternations are allowed. It makes us like robots and  feel bad psychologically, because we want to be different and free in   wearing. Also the attendance rules put a strain on us. If we don't come to school for 10 days, then we can't pass the class. They don't care if we have problems, exams to study  or if we are ill.\n\nAt homes we have again rules, but more flexible ones. You should be punctual when coming to  dining table, respectful, do your home works and watch TV less and not too loud.\n\nI would like to change the attendance and clothing rules in school, but I don't have the enough power.

I made people enjoyed their weekend, relaxed themselves,  also it brought the foreign culture to them, enlarged their kownlegth. In addition to it, one weekend ticket for all  events was only £10, this was excellent, it made people only spend pocket-money, and then they could watch all the events at the weeked, for them it is  really economical  to spent their weekend. So my friends told me that  was his cheapest weekend.\n\nMoreover, the stars and artists were only from six countries, In my opinion, if you can invite more stars and artists from more countries, it will make the festival more exciting, more intesting, and from my point of view, some  concert halls were too small, the people in there couldn't even go to the loo! because it was too crowed. Finally, the plays and films were wonderfully welcomed, as far as I'm concerned. If you can show more play and films It will achieve a good effect.\n\nThis are only my inmature views, if it is considerable for you, I will be very pleased, thank you very much.\n\nI'm look forward to hearing your replies.\n\nyours sincerely,", "age": "16-20", "q": "1", "script-s": "26", "edits": [[0, [[38, 47, "saw", "TV"], [135, 137, "", "UT"], [189, 203, "well organised", "UP"], [293, 301, null, "DJ"], [302, 307, "view", "FN"], [388, 389, "It", "RA"], [390, 394, "allowed", "RV"], [402, 409, "to enjoy", "FV"], [425, 432, "relax", "FV"], [433, 443, "", "UA"], [445, 445, "and", "MC"], [462, 465, "a", "RD"], [491, 499, "broadening", "RV"], [506, 515, "knowledge", "S"], [532, 534, "this", "RA"], [563, 563, "the", "MD"], [583, 589, ".

The Musical started at 20:15 not at 14:30 - as you have mentioned. It was very surprising for me and I had got a lot of trouble with coming back home at night - when it finished.\n\nFurthermore, there was no Danny Brook at the stage. She is my famous artist and I was coming there mainly because of him. If this made me really disappointed - he wasn't playing there.\n\nAnother point, I want you to consider, is  restaurant. The place you have offered was closed and there was nothing to eat inside the theatre at all. Despite changing the hours, you have closed the restaurant without any reason. Could you possibly explain why you didn't provide us  anything to eat?\n\nFinally, you have advertised, I would have  perfect evening out. Unfortunately, I can't say that. I am very disappointed and I would like to ask you for giving my money back.

It's a REALITY, its the FASHION OF THE FUTURE...\n\nPeople were wearing almost everything, during more than 2000 years of their living on Earth. Everything was changing: style, colour qual. Fashion. Their clothes were always strictly connected with their lifestyle, climate and money. We saw almost all kinds of skirts, trousers, coats, skirts and even hats - which untill nowadays are the main point of many fashion creatures. What can we suspect then? What something new hasn't been invented for now? I say it to you - black and grey. These are two powerful colours, which will be expanding for the nearest 100 years.\n\nThe climate is changing, so we would have only two seasons. And we will need only two colours: grey for hot days and black for cold ones. Women will wear only skirts and dresses but men will be strictly connected with trousers. I hope, there will be times, when women would like to be again thought as delicate and sensible human beings. Showing their figure, they would have  possibility to show their sexuality. But, don't forget, any exhibitionism! We have too many taken off people around us, now. And it will be  the past. Streets of  21st century will be smart.\n\nSo, are you interested in that style?

However, I was completely disappointed when I was told that there were not any discounts for the show.\n\n3.

I was really hungry after the show and was pissed off.\n\nWith all the above points, I would like to ask for some money return.

Then, I discovered some points and I am writing to express my suggestion and recommendations.\n\nFirstly, the title 'International Arts Festival' is very suitable for the festival, because there were some variety of features in it. Next, One reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is also  fantastic idea, because everyone could enjoy everything by the ticket.\n\nHowever, according to my notes, there are some doubt in the festival. While you stated that there were stars and artists from around the world, they were from only six countries in fact. The number of plays and films were also very few. In addition to that some concert halls were too small  to enjoy the concerts.\n\nOn balance, I feel that this annual festival can be even better next year. Therefore, I strongly recommend that you should collect artists and stars  more than six countries and rebuild larger concert halls. I also suggest that more plays and films should be taken place.

There are new products which you could not imagine that could be so interesting. Shopping is a good way to kill your time and some times you can not realize how fast the time goes. This happens because people enjoy themselves a lot.\n\nOn the other hand there are some disadvantages. for example if you are a working mother with three children, that means you are always n a hurry, going shopping is really unenjoyable. You go shopping in a big supermarket because you know you will find everything there and you need 15 minutes to find the goods and 20 minutes to pay for them because of the big queue.\n\nYou need to buy essential items like food and you get tired because it  very crowded and you spend more time thank you prefer to.\n\nIn Conclusion shopping is enjoyable but not when it is too buzy.

Surfing would be another good option because I have never stepped on a surfboard and I think this is a beautiful sport.\n\nI'd like to know about the kind of clothes I should take, if it's cold or hot by this time of the year and if I should bring any money.\n\nI have butterflies of excitement and I'am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nCarlitos Andrade", "age": "16-20", "q": "1", "script-s": "33", "edits": [[0, [[58, 62, "which", "S"], [337, 339, "for my", "R"], [403, 407, "if it", "R"], [437, 441, "if in", "R"], [464, 472, "closer", "RJ"], [607, 609, "", "UA"], [864, 871, "at that", "R"], [930, 955, "butterflies in my stomach", "ID"], [960, 964, "I am", "UP"]]]], "l1": "pt", "id": "TR296*0100*2000*01", "answer-s": "4.1"}

According to your advertisment the play should have started at 19:30. Unfortunately there was an unexplained delay of 45 minutes. The audience had to sit and wait until 20:15. What made the situation worse is that no explanation for the delay was given; not even an apologation. We had been told that discounts to the ticket-prices were possible but at the evening of the show no discounts or special offers whatsoever were offered. After the show we had intended to visit your theatre restaurant which was - to our surprise - closed because of the time delay! So we had to leave hungry and with a certain feeling of frustration and disappointment. Honestly for us it was not that \"perfect evening out\".

{"text": "\"The old man and the Sea\"\n\nDear Tim,\n\nI'm writing to you regarding the radio programme next Saturday where \"The old man and the Sea\" by Earnest Hemingway will be read. I recommend you listen to it! As you know we have already had several discussions about literature and what it can tell or teach us. I suppose you still wonder what the great authors can do for us? Therefore Hemingway is a very good example. He fought in the Spanish Civil war and in World War II  always on the search for answers to questions like \"... what defines a man\", or \"... what happens to us in critical situations\". These experiences influenced him so deeply that he described his feelings in several books. One of the most interesting ones is \"The old man and the Sea\". A story of an old seaman leaving his town to proove that he is still able to catch the biggest fish ever caught. The story describes his feelings, thoughts, fears and emotions during a struggle with a giant deep-sea fish. In the end he wins but before he is able to get back he has to \"sacrifice\" his fish to attacking sharks. So did he finally win or loose? An interesting story - demanding in a way - which can give you an impression of Hemingway's work and what he meant by \"pace under pressure\".\n\nI hope you will enjoy it! Please let me know!\n\nI'm looking forward to hearing from you.\n\nKind regards\n\nM.

{"text": "Dear Kim!\n\nToday I have to tell you something really exciting and also very hard to believe. Last month I received a letter which told me that I've entered a competition. I was so happy and suprised that I first could not really believe it.  But it was true. My price was the chance to meet a pop group and to help at the concert. The pop group which was going to act is called \"Metallica\" and I like their music very much ('cause in my opinion the music is a bit different from all the songs you usually listen to.) But now to the concert itself. It took place on the 10th of June in Salzburg. I started at 8 pm but I had to be there at 11 am. First I had to help with the catering which lasted until 2 pm. After this I met the band members and got to know them while we were having a good meal. The front man felt a bit sick and so he skipped the meal. I was so excited that I also was not able to eat anything. At 5 pm the band members disappeared again and I was responsible for some kind of guiding tour for the journalists. I had to show them the way to the interviewing room. It was a bit boring but more or less okay. At 7 p.m. the first group started. They were unknown and not very good but when I met them afterwards I recognised that they are very nice. At 8 pm Metallica started and I have to tell you, they did a great performance. When I met them after the concert they asked me questions like Did you like the performance! or How do you think about the first group? Questions like you and I usually ask each other. You know what I mean, they were not conceited or something like this. They were like any other person and I have to admit that I like them very much.

First of all in the advertisement  was written, as I had read that before, that Danny Brook would be starring in the show. Unfortunately, the different actor stood in for in it. The time of the beginning of the show was written at half past two p.m. and at half past seven that evening, again. Lack of my time made me to go at the evening show. And unfortunately again, from some reasons it was postponed to quarter past eight. Another problem - in the advertisement  was exactly written  some of the discounts of the tickets. No, alas in reality it appeared  a mistake. According to the advertisement, after the show anyone could go to the theatre restaurant for a drink. That appeared impossible, because the theatre restaurant was closed. The reason was unknown. That wasn't enough yet. At the end of the advertisement as I noticed it was said something of  perfect evening out. It wasn't truth. That's why I write my letter to you and I ask for my money back. I was expecting something really better.

Once students have taken a shower after a hard physical training they come to real life, depending on their levels  they have to study for instance languages wich I personally find very important for a person working in the tourism field because these enables stuff to communicate with clients in a proper way, students have to manage to speak at least three languages. Another important lesson to film is \"culture and civilization, therefore people will know that the hostessess prepered at this school are not only, as  French say, \"pot-au-fleurs\", beautiful faces to show off but also well read persons. Last but not less important is the class called \"know-how\" wich shows students how to cope with unspected problems even if they are in stress. I would also take an outdoor lesson \"training\".

Tennis I only started four years ago, but have found that I am quite talented at it, having won several competitions during the last two years or so.\n\nPlease let me know if meals are included and if not which facilities are offered in the way of restaurants or self-catering.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely", "age": "51-", "q": "1", "script-s": "35", "edits": [[0, [[244, 249, "would", "RV"], [493, 503, "awkward", "RJ"], [504, 506, "for", "RT"], [876, 881, "what", "RQ"]]]], "l1": "de", "id": "TR383*0100*2000*01", "answer-s": "4.3"}

The money that I spent on shopping can help them a lot if I would not do it before.

There should be no beds at home because some pills are invented to make people not sleepy.

People will do anything on the computer, including watching TV, listen to music,  chat with people.

Firstly I would like to explain  you where the problem is. I came to London for a short journey to meet new poeple and to have a meeting with an English culture. I've seen your advertisment which had recommended the play 'Over the rainbow' and I enjoyed it very much. I decided to go to the Circle Theatre with  hope that your show will provide me  all these emotions that I have been looking for in Great Britain. Please forgive me but you didn't do your best. I heard about Danny Brook in Poland and I wanted to see him on the scene but it wasn't hardly possible. There was a change of the leader-actor what annoyed me indeed. Further more the show was to begin at about 19.30 but it didin't. You were 45 minutes late. Waiting was horrible. On the advertisment was written 'DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE' shall I ask you one question? - Why they weren't available? Everybody were schocked and I was trying to keep the faith. I didin't expect more surprises at your Theatre. Nevertheless after the show I was very hungry so I went to the theatre restarrant and what  I've seen? A poster: \"Closed because of the illness of the chef.\" There were some more disappointing situations about which I don't want to write. Eventually - you offered a wonderflul evening but I must say that if I had known that it is going to be like that I wouldn't have wasted my time.

Each one was fantastic and fill in with euration, but I'd appreciate more place, because unfortunately some concert halls were too small!\n\nYou certainly saw that  plays and films had a lot of success. So, I wanted to know if there will be more films next year. It could be an advantage!\n\nAn other excellent thing was your choice for the entry. That was a great idea to have just one ticket for all events. That was simpler than an other way of selling tickets (practical and attractive).\n\nFinally, I want you to make a suggestion for next year. It would be better if people have had the possibility to let their cars very near to the Festival during the week-end!\n\nI am sure you'll pay attention to my suggestions and advice and I am looking forward to seeing you next year.\n\nYours sincerely,", "age": "16-20", "q": "1", "script-s": "27", "edits": [[0, [[84, 92, "enjoyed", "IV"], [114, 122, null, "RN"], [237, 245, "festival", "RP"], [304, 304, null, "MQ"], [324, 327, "advertisement", "L"], [330, 334, "", "UY"], [341, 341, "the", "MD"], [351, 351, "of", "MT"], [414, 439, null, "CE"], [465, 470, "space", "RN"], [553, 553, "the", "MD"], [667, 676, null, "RN"], [679, 687, "Another", "RP"], [728, 733, null, "RN"], [819, 821, "the", "RD"], [866, 876, null, "RJ"], [896, 899, "", "UA"], [965, 973, "had", "TV"], [978, 989, "chance", "RN"], [993, 996, "park", "RV"], [1025, 1033, "festival", "RP"], [1045, 1053, "weekend", "UP"]]]], "l1": "fr", "id": "TR406*0102*2000*02", "answer-s": "4.1"}

Just to remind you of which show I am talking about, it is called \"Over the Rainbow\".\n\nThere were  couple of things I noted down during the show. One of the reasons that I chose to see this show was to see Danny Brook live. But there was a different actor instead of him. I am very disappointed. Another problem that bothered me about the show was its late start. Instead of starting at 19:30 pm, it started at 20:15 pm. I had a meeting straight after the show but I was late and made  fool of my self by arriving late and  all those people starring at me and whispering. Then I found out that the discounts are not available but on the notice board, it said that they are available. After the show, I noticed that the theatre restaurant was closed because it was closed that day.\n\nThe evening that I spent there was terrible so please may I have my money back.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRaulet.", "age": "0-16", "q": "1", "script-s": "30", "edits": [[0, [[195, 195, "a", "MD"], [582, 582, "a", "MD"], [591, 598, "myself", "RP"], [620, 620, "had to suffer", "MV"], [638, 646, "staring", "IV"], [705, 708, "were", "TV"], [746, 747, "", "UP"], [766, 769, "were", "TV"]]]], "l1": "ru", "id": "TR429*0102*2000*01", "answer-s": "4.1"}

We didn't have trouble to find our seats, but we found  very annoying to have waited 45 minutes before the show goes on and more  that your famous actors weren't absolutely Mr Brook and Mrs Truelove and we can also add that your restaurant wasn't opened because of hygienic troubles.

You can now know what happens on the other side of the world, at the same time  it is happening. What is more, you can get the information you need in just one second by pressing the \"enter\" key in a computer.\n\nFurthermore, as we all know, day life now a days is quite simplier and an example of this is that instead of buying a peice of ice to cool drinks (as our grandparents used to do) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it faster and cooler. Strange as it seems, we now can have every  machine or especialized technology to make our dayly life more confortable and less workable. Things that human beings used to do, now are being done by computers and machines more efficiently and rapidly.\n\nOne the other hand, despite the fact that technology make things easier in our day life, the same happens in industries and companies where they use computers and machines instead of people. As people do not get a job because  is not needed they get into poorness, criminal activities, being isolated and without the possibility of getting a good education. This is the most terribly disadvantage technology has.\n\nWith advantages and disadvantages, technology is in our life and may represent an advance for some and a bad thing for others.

I wondered who had told you about I had helped  a pop concert last month. Anyway, it is doesn't matter now who had told you, but I was very happy and enjoyed it. Well, I am going to tell you about it.\n\nFirst of all, I had to been train by the concert's staff for a day. Before the concert started I had to help the staff prepared a stage,  like put the instruments where they should be on the stage,. And then, I had to help the singer to do some make up. I was very frightening I might put too much make up on their faces, but everything was allright. After that, I had to help them to prepare some lunch when the concert had started. I was running around to find something I could do, like serving some drinks for  staffs or the singers.\n\nAfter the concert finished I had to help them cleaned up everything. I was so tired, but enjoyed. I really like to help people without  something back. This experience I was so prond  and very enjoyed. I think I didn't waste my time at all. I spent my free time to helping them  its made my life a little bit busy. I think I have learnt a lot from this experience. To helping people you should not expect anything back to you, except happiness and enjoyable.\n\nWell, I think I must stop writing now. I hope you are enjoying with my experience.

He asked to me to go and when he told me the group was Radiohead I felt  the luckiest person in the world (you know I've always been an enthusiastic fan of them, so you can imagine how excited I was). I couldn't wait for it.\n\nWhen we arrived there we had to prepare the stage, clean everything and put a number on each seat.\n\nBut the most amazing thing happened later, when ten minutes before the concert began, my friend told me we could see it from the backside of the stage. For a while I thought it was a dream. The playing was excellent, the public enjoyed it very much but, above all, I was there, at ten metres from my favourite group. I even got a few friendly words from the singer in a piece of paper: I hope you've enjoyed it. And his signature.

We waited for 45 minutes.\n\nSecondly, when the show started, I was looking for Danny Brook, because this actor was the most important reason for me to come here. I realised that it was  different actor playing instead of Danny brook. I was very disappointed.

They just said, \"we don't give money back.\"\n\nHowever we wanted to eat something at the Theatre Restaurant, but it was again  same with the others, because the restaurant was closed.\n\nFinally, we had a totally unhappy night with your show.

I was very disapointed to find out that most of the things said in the advertisement for the show were not true.\n\nFor example, the advertisement said that Danny Brook would be the lead actor, but he was not. Instead, there was this unknown actor with a very bad performance and  a terribly annoying voice. Moreover, the play did not start at the time it was supposed to.

Then I drove very slowly very ofen crossing the white line on the road. I looked at the mirror and I saw how my friends were lauthing. It made my crazy. I started doing stupid things: turn right instead of left and so on.\n\nNext day, I decided that I don't want to go to school any more. I was afraid that everybody would comment  my first lesson. I wish I hadn't told Pat about my plans. Eventually the things weren't so bad. I went to school and everyone was very friendly. Pat appologized  me for not keeping the secrets.

About accomodation, I prefer stay  log cabins because I don't like to stay in tents which are unconfortable for me. I am not also keen on preparing it.\n\nThis prize, I can choose two activities, can't you. So, I am going to choose Golf and Tennis. In Japan, I often play Golf but as you know Japanese weather condition is not  enough  enjoying play Golf but California has good weather which are every day sunshuin, hopefuly. I used to play tennis when I was  university student. I am interst  playing tennis very much.\n\nFinaly, I have some question. When I join this camp, what kind of clothes should I carry? Moreover, how much money do I have to need?

I had read your advertisement in a morning newspaper and the show seemed very attractive to me. Moreover an English friend of mine had told me that it would purely be a good show as Danny Brook was a very good actor.\n\nSo on Saturday, June 7, I was there for the 7:30 pm show and here are my reasons for complaining. Firstly, there were no discounts available  as  stated in your advertisement, not even for students, and I had to pay for a full-price ticket. Secondly, we had to wait until 8:00 pm before being able to have a seat and the show finally beginned at 8:15!\n\nNo need to say how much I was disappointed to see that another actor was performing instead of Danny Brook and the actor didn't seem to have rehearsed the role very much. At the end of the show, I decided to have dinner in your theatre restaurant and I went there ...just to find out that it was closed because it was being newly painted.\n\nTo sum up, it was not the \"perfect evening out!\" you advertised. So I am asking you to pay me back at least half of the ticket price for the inconvenience that was caused to me.

{"text": "Introduction\n\nThe aim of this report is to describe and assess daily life at this school and suggest which lessons and other activities should be filmed. This is based on a questionnair conducted in the school and our English department's investigation.\n\nLessons\n\nAccording to statistics based on the questionnair, the majority of students feel the most enthusiasm for an English class. This may be thanks to native speaker teachers who came to the school last year. In fact, I visited some Englishe classes to find out that most students tried to answer questions and speak to native teachers. Furthermore less numbers of students were nodding off comparing with other classes like Maths. Consequently it might be a good idea to film the English class so that the vibrant and active atomosphere may be able to be filmed. This may also contribute to the promotion of  English department.\n\nExtra activities\n\nIt was found that hockey is the most popular sport among students. As the record says, our hockey team has been on the top of the league for three successive years. The girls' football team is also famous for its reputation of keeness on practice. Although every school has a boys' football team, our school is the only one which possesses a girls' team. Team members can be interviewed.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo sum up, our school is famous for achievements in several fields as well as academic achievements. The whole point of making a video is to tell people that we are not only bugs of books but also enjoying our school life.

Certainly, buying things can be a pleasant activity, especially if you are acquiring the goods for yourself. But situations in which you do not need to move carefully in order to avoid stepping on someone's feet are quite rare and, when they do happen, time passes by very fast. However, if you are another fool standing amidst the crowd, waiting for the queue to move, time slowly melts.\n\nBelieve me, shopping can also be painful. Your feet will turn into pancakes after a long day out in the streets and your muscles can get seriously injured after carrying all those bags which contain loads of objects. Amazingly, doctors tell people to look after their bodies during Christmas time: shopping can cause you a large variety of undesireble pains.\n\nNonetheless, people still find some obscure pleasure in putting their mental health at stake.

There were so many exciting things I saw, such as stars and artists from around the world. Jazz, rock and classical concerts, plays and dance show etc. The specified thing  is worth to remind here is the reasonably-priced ticket for all events, it is excellent because most tourist could offer what they like.\n\nAlthough how I enjoyed it, there were still something  needed to be improved. For example, there were some conert halls which was too small to hold so much people, the stars and artists were just from six countries, which is not enough for  audience.

{"text": "Dear Magda\n\nIt is lovely to get your letter so soon.\n\nYou mentioned the rules at home and at school in the letter. This remind me of what I experienced during my teeenage . In my country the children go to the secondary school when they are at the first year of  teenage. Your know, this age is the trouble age, boys have too much energy and girls want to fall in love with someone. These always annoy the school teacher and  parents. In a result of these the teachers make very strict rules at school, such as students aren't allowed to speak  each other in the class. They had to finish homework in a limited time. They cannot oppose to the teacher, girls are not allowed to  make up and wear any accessories. At home, in my experience, my parents didn't allow me to go out in the evening and gave me much amsh homework to do, even in the holiday. They also forbidden me to make a boyfriend. I think it is not just what happened in my home many of my friend had the same experience.\n\nNow I'm a mother of two children. They are all in the school. Comparing to my experience, I want to give them  more open attitude about everything. I want to be a mother of them and a friend of them. But at school, although I hope the teacher don't give students so much homework,  don't forbidden the opposite voice of the students, there are nothing I can do because of our culture.

We believe that the programme is very cood and well organised and we would like to thank you one more time especially for that.\n\nThe other reason as I mention earlier is because of a request off all the class. We've seen an advertisement in the newspapers, about a Fashion exhibition in London on Tuesday the 14 of March. That is one of the 3 days that we will spent in London as a college. So we had this great idea if it is possible of course to include this exhibition in our programme.\n\nThe exhibition is caud the London Fashion and Leisure Show and it taking place at the Central Exhibition hall, in London From 10.00 till 19.00.\n\nThe class is very exiting about that because the Show conteins the latest Fashions, leisure and Sports Wear, make up and hair styles. We believe that  is a great opportunity because  is one of the best shows of the year, also a majority of the class never had the change to visit a show as this and the most important and best part is that the admission is Free for Students. And that we found it very good as otherwise we could not afford it.\n\nSo please if it is possible  to make a small change to the programme and to move the activities of the Tuesday 14 of March to the 15 of March  as to try to make a combination of the 2 days.\n\nWe hope we do not cause any problems to your programme and hope that you will except our request.

{"text": "Dear Kim\n\nHow are you? I am sorry that I didn't write any letter to your during  last month. I really wish you were with me last month. Quess what I've done! I've been helping at a pop concert that happened at my school. That's why I have no time and wanted you to be there with me. I will tell you all about it!\n\nAs you know I took art for my GCSE and fortunately I like it and get quite good marks for my project, about light and sound. So my art teacher came to me and my best friend, who is really good at art too, and asked whether I can be able and willing to help for the concert in two weeks time in the concert hall. I immediately say \"yes\" and also my friend. I really think it sounds so interesting. I have never done light and sound for the real pop concert before and I think it will be a good experience for me. Actually I've just done light and sound in  drama's day in my school at the end of last term. But this time it'll be different, I thought. Do you know that this concert will be on television.\n\nThe preperation days came. The first day we started to work for this concert, the real professionals came. Their jobs are preparing  concert. I had a chance to talk to them about their jobs and it was amuzing! It sounded very interesting to me. Then we started to talk about what we have to do for this concert. I have learnt lots of things about preparing  stage, light, sound, background. I felt like I'm one of those professional too because they always called me and my friend to help them and that made me learn lots of thing from doing the practical work. All of them were very nice and friendly. Another exciting part was, I had to climb to put the lights up. Can you imagine the real concert, and how high the lights always like? It was good fun though! , but my friend didn't like doing that at all. She didn't seem to enjoyed it as much as I do.\n\nAt the end of the day, my ambition is to be like one of the professionals. I really do hope I can be like them. My teacher was very proud of me because after the concert, all the staff were saying how helpful I was and so on.

It would be essential because many people in the class are thinking of studying fashion in future. The entrance fee is free for students so the show is well worth seeing.\n\nTo go to the show, we need to alter the programme. The show is on 14th and takes a whole day. So, if we could go to the Museum by using the free time on 15th it would be okay although we could not go shopping.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you shortly.\n\nYours sincerely,", "age": "16-20", "q": "1", "script-s": "38", "edits": [[0, [[107, 117, "In particular", "RY"], [159, 164, "will", "TV"], [176, 186, "opportunity", "S"], [431, 433, "At", "RT"], [478, 485, "fashions", "FN"], [485, 486, " -", "RP"], [487, 510, "leisure- and sports-wear", "MP"], [512, 519, "make-up", "MP"], [539, 547, "is", "TV"], [635, 647, "Entrance", "UD"], [648, 651, "", "UN"], [783, 788, "lasts", "RV"]]]], "l1": "ja", "id": "TR606*0100*2000*02", "answer-s": "5.2"}

The uniform, we are wearing has to be perfect. No one is allowed to wear anything which isn't written in the school rules. The general rules which are used in all schools aren't so strict however there are a few things that need to be changed. For example if you don't come to school  10 days in a year we fail that year.\n\nThank God it isn't so strict at home. My family allows me almost every thing except smoking and drinking alchol of course, which I don't do anyway. I am allowed to stay up late, I'm allowed to bring my friends home and stuff like that. However there is one thing that my parents don't like me to do. They hate it when I listen to music loudly.

As well as this, after seeing the musical I went to the theatre restaurant, which you referred  in your advertisement, but it was closed already. I was really angry!\n\nLastly, with reference to ticket prices, your theatre hadn't any discounts even for children. I had to buy an adult ticket for my child and spent more money than I had expected.\n\nI am sure you can imagine what I felt. It was not  perfect evening for me and my child at all!

{"text": "Futuristic Designs Of People's Homes\n\nTechnology has been improved by human being rapidly. This technologic improvement is changing people's lifes, behaviours even their homes. Can you imagine? What people's homes will it be like in fifty years time?\n\nI guess there will be more gadget to do some housework easier. Maybe there will be some robots to do our ironings, washing our dishes, cleaning everywhere, hoovering, etc. Will it make life easier? Maybe yes, maybe no. Of course these gadgets will do our hard houseworks but otherwise we will get lazy, we will lose our abilities that we have now.\n\nNow IT (information technology) is in our life. We can get everything we want to know from computers. It means we won't need to go somewhere to get some information we need. We'll be stuck to our computers at home. Whatever we need we order from to  computer and someone will bring . It means we'll lose our social lifes.\n\nBut we can't stop to  technologic improvement. We should use it in positif ways. When people use to the technology they should know that  is not everything. They should seek to other lifes outside their homes.\n\nI guess that with technology people will spend their life much more in their homes. It doesn't seem to me alright. Our homes should just protect us  dangeres from outside. But I believe human will never forget what they used to be.\n\nMankind has been always seeking different things. We'are learning a lot of things about life. and we are practicing these . In the future life will be more artifitual than I had been before.\n\nProbably our homes will be smaller than now. Because  human population is growing quickly and people prefer to stay  big cities (like London, New York, Paris). It means there will be too many people in small areas. Then there will have been built smaller houses, flats, buildings, etc. Outside big cities there won't be any people at all.

Secondly, you cannot exclude that you might get  a pick-pocket which would make you upset and irritated when you think of that you could avoid it and that you could take less money in your wallet from home.\n\nIn addition to this, even if you buy something you would like, you can change your mind at home. Sometimes, a moment comes up that you would like to buy something you have not wanted because while you are shopping, you might get something beautiful or good to you. So you would spend more money  you have expected.\n\nTo sum up, you should spend money as your plan and you should be cautious and sensible to make it enjoyable.", "age": "31-40", "q": "3", "script-s": "30", "edits": [[0, [[195, 198, "thing", "R"], [218, 223, "", "UT"], [289, 291, "", "UT"], [292, 296, "", "UD"], [414, 415, "", "UP"], [419, 422, "", "UD"], [431, 439, "occasions", "FN"], [445, 447, "during", "RT"], [448, 448, "a", "MD"], [476, 483, null, "RV"], [503, 503, "robbed by", "M"], [577, 581, "how", "R"], [651, 660, "", "U"], [714, 719, "", "UV"], [786, 788, "", "UY"], [935, 940, "", "UV"], [958, 958, "than", "MC"], [963, 967, "had", "TV"], [1013, 1015, "according to", "RT"]]]], "l1": "ko", "id": "TR622*0100*2000*01", "answer-s": "3.3"}

I would rather live in a tent than a log cabin in order to be close to nature I adore the sound of the wind, trees, animals and everything which is surrounding . I could feel the environment.\n\nThirdly, as far as the activities I have to choose, I would prefer swimming as well as tennis.

I know how impatient you are  about it and I just want to let you know that it was something amazing!\n\nAs I've told you, last month I went at a pop concert and I really enjoy helping with the preparation. It took place in a huge stadium which had over 4.000 seats for the \"spactetors\" if you can call them like this. Can you imagine?\n\nThere was a large stage which we had to clean by sweeping. That was a little bit odd but and funny at the same time. Another thing we had to do was help the staff to tranfer some equipment. The musicians brough it in order to achieve a high standard of quality sound. We had to be very careful. Have you any idea how much does this stuff  worth? You don't even want to know.\n\nApart from these we were mainly helping the singers to be prepared for the concert. They had to chose their clothes,  give one last performance before the big night and everything had to be perfect!\n\nEven if I could use 100 sheets it wouldn't be enough to describe my experience and the things that I've gained through it! I've learned the meaning of the words \"reliability\" and \"responsibility\".

Students think that we don't do anything and we don't learn anything spessial. It's not true. We practice our English and I think we have to film our English lessons, so others can see that to study this way is better than to study the way how they do. Also Math. lessons are so interesting. Many people don't like Math because they think that it's  boreing subject. I think it's all depends of  teacher. Our Math. teacher knows how to teach so we don't get tired of his lessons. I think we should film the Math. lessons, so students and some teachers will change their opinion about Math. For activities we should film sport lessons because we always do something new. We do many competitions with other schools, and we always have fun. Our music lessons are speccial. We try to play on many instruments,  sing even if we don't know how.

Danny Brook was the reason that most people came to see the show. After some time a few of them started to leave the theatre. I was a little more portient so I stayed to watch the hole show, which by the way was the worst I had ever seen. I don't know why I payed £20 with no discounts as the advertisements said it woul have. Then I thougt that I should go to the theatre restaurant to have a drink or eat something so that I couldn't say that I wasted my time by coming here. I became furious when I saw that it was closed because there weren't any employees to work  .\n\nSo, I went home as fast as I could to write you this letter.

Like earings, necklaces, bracelets, rings, glasses, hairbands, hand bags, shoes, watches, etc. They like designers clothes and everyone wear different modern clothes in size, in colour and in shapes.\n\nThe fashion gradually changed from the old days and it is still changing to the future. Maybe in 100 years from now, fashion will be totally different. Everyone may think that in  future people will wear silver clothes like in space movies.\n\nI think everyone will wear balloons for clothes in  future.

They will bounced on roads with there balloon clothes.\n\nIn  future they will wear balloon clothes, because to make people fly. They will use a special gas inside  balloons to make them fly.\n\nFor the special gas they will mix carbon dioxide and some chemicals. This special gas will be not dangerous. If we use up carbon dioxide with  balloon clothes there will be less carbon dioxide on Earth, so there is no worry about Ozone breaking. This is one more reason to wear balloon clothes in  future.

After we waited for half an hour to get two spare seat tickets, we had to wait 45 minutes until it started. One of the points because, I wanted to see the musical was my favourite actor Danny Brook, but he didn't play! So when the miserable musical came to his end, we were happy to leave the theater room, but we both wanted to have dinner in the theatre restaurant, because no restaurantes were opened anymore, because it started too late. So we went upstairs to find the restaurant, but we just  a big empty hall, with nothing in it, with a short sign on a door: \"Sorry, we are closed because of renovations\"!

I'm also the member of  photography club at my university and really keen on taking a picture of nature.\n\nBy the way, I'm wondering what kinds of clothes I should prepare and how much much I should bring with myself.

Additionally, 15% of students answered  they want the presentation lesson to be filmed. The reason why they choose this lesson is that every student in their turn of presentation does his or her best.\n\nPrefered activities.\n\nThe soccer game, played every Monday, was ranked in the most favorite activity by 45%  students. They said the soccer game enable them to get together and have fun. However, the girls'd rather play table tennis or badminton. Hicking activity was chosen by 20%  students, followed by the soccer.\n\nConclusion.\n\nTo sum up, according to the survey, it's obvious that more than half of  students want  acting lesson to be filmed.

{"text": "I remember some sientific cartoons when I was younger I watched on television. They describe the future world where people would travel to the moon. But it is coming true now. Modern technology has been changing even my daily life in positive and negative ways at the same time.\n\nFirst it helps  my social life to be convinient. I have got my own computer so it is easy for me to send e-mails to my friends very often. Second I can save time. If there was no public transport like  underground in a big city I couldn't imagine travelling on time.\n\nOn the other hand, modern technology could affect my life in a bad way. Because of computeres or telephones I could have less chances to meet my friends than before. It could make my emotions fade. Another problem is pollution. I think a car is one of the most common products of modern technology. The more cars there are on the street, the more difficult it is for me to keep myself fit.\n\nTo sum it up, as technology is improving my life itself is becoming convinient. In spite of its good sides I think my life could get worse. To live in this world needs somebody else to contact and health. But I am loosing chances to meet my friend face to face and I feel I am getting weaker. I suppose people including me should keep themselves in a limited their own space in near future.

It will be really an annoying thing when you are keen on something but you can't afford it. One of my friend, Emma, happened to see a fantastic jacket which costs £105.

Thieves will try to put their hands in our wallets and purses, and even the so called 'plastic money' is not always safe.\n\nHunting on the High Street, or the Shopping Malls, for the desired bargain - because we cant afford otherwise to buy  - becomes often a desperate atempt to reach a living promoted by the new consuming society.

Unfortunately, in the last edition there were artists who cames from only six countries, so I think you should invite artists from other countries, for example from Africa.\n\nSecondly, I appreciated the fact that there were concerts of different kind of music, but in this case the main problem was that some concerts hall were too small, and because of it I couldn't see one of the concerts in  programme.\n\nIn my opinion, one of the best things of the last Festival was that there were not only concerts . I saw films and I played ping-pong. In the next edition will  be more or less ? I hope more.

{"text": "The respect of Famous people's private life has always been a hot topic... On the one hand, those people are equal to us in the way that they had a childhood, thy got married and built a family... The only difference between them and us is the kind of job they are doing which is literally a \"public job\". Therefore, why do we have to talk and gossip about them?! But on the other hand, the aim of a \"public job\" such as politician or actor is to be known and appreciated by the population. And here comes the paradox: Do we have to reveal someone's privacy to judge his work and appreciate him? Well, some people would agree whereas others would desagree. I guess this is an unanswerable question...\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, I would say that famous people made the choice to be followed and tracked by journalists all the time, when they chose to be famous. That's as simple as this! Everyone is aware of the celebrity's consequences so, if they really wanted their privacy, why did they choose a \"public job\"?? Even if anyone deserve to have a private life, famous people know and might have made a mistake... However, I would add that journalists - being aware of that hard topic - should try to modorate what they write in order to respect altrui's privacy; since they would probably not be glad to have their own private life revealed!\n\nBut to solve this problem, we may think first about its origin... \"Reading the gossips\": isn't it what anyone of us love doing?? Therefore we should try to educate ourselves so as to respect altrui in his privacy.\n\nWhy not?\n\nTo conclude, I would say that \"privacy\" and \"celebrity\" can't go together.

But maybe you want to hear the story from the beginning.\n\nAs you know Luna Pop is not my favourite group and I went to their concert only because Ake needed being accompanied. When we arrived she persuaded me to go the backstage because her boyfriend was the electrician of the band. It didn't sound very exciting to me but I accepted above all because I was curious. Unfortunately what I found wasn't what I expected. Everyone was upset, worried or angry and Lucre, Ake's boyfriend, explained that it was because their pianist had broken his arm and couldn't play.  In that moment Ake exlaimed that I could play the piano. After that I tried to tell them I had just begun  but within five minutes I was on the stage and I was playing that, luckily, easy tune.\n\nI think you can't believe in what I've told you but I won't forget this experience. This has been the first time I have realized that, maybe, playing the piano could be my future and, even though I was really frightened, I enjoyed staying on the stage with all those eyes on me.\n\nI wish you had been with me but I'm sure you understand what I felt.\n\nLove\n\nMafalda", "age": "16-20", "q": "4", "script-s": "35", "edits": [[0, [[240, 240, ",", "MP"], [328, 333, "to be", "FV"], [386, 389, "", "UD"], [430, 453, "band's electrician", "W"], [506, 515, "anyway", "R"], [738, 752, "Just then", "ID"], [757, 765, "exclaimed", "S"], [844, 844, "to learn", "MV"], [933, 958, "I don't think you can believe", "X"], [959, 961, "", "UT"], [1164, 1171, "being", "RV"]]]], "l1": "it", "id": "TR799*0100*2000*01", "answer-s": "5.2"}

If I want to go to training I need not wait for the bus, and so I need not start one and a half hour before training I start a half hour before. So I save one hour, which I can use for other hobbies or for homework or something else. The same problem with mobile phones, if I got one I needn't go to the public phones, I save time. If I  got  Internet I can send e-mails, I needn't go to the letter box, I save time. In my daily life I can save time, but I think every body should use  his saved time for things like hiking, walking, swimming, for a \"natural life\" and not for a life in a technical world with stress and sorrows because we are humans and not robots.

{"text": " RIGHT TIME FOR SHOPPING\n\nWhy do people like shopping? First answer is that they need  shopping. Second answer is that the shopping makes everyone happy. If I get bored I can't stay at home and I feel  going shopping. When I do shopping I don't think about any problems I have. It's very relaxing for me but  if it is possible to do  shopping. Sometimes it can be nightmare if you can't find something that you are looking for.\n\nI think the weekends are not the right time to go shopping. I went shopping last week with my friend she needed to buy a nightdress. We spent for three hours and we couldn't buy anything. It was incredibly crowded. We couldn't even move and the most people were just looking and were wasting of their time.\n\nIf you are in a hurry, don't go shopping! It is not really  good idea to go shopping if you don't have enough time.\n\nImagine you have three children and you are going shopping with them. I can tell you how bad  situation you are in because when I was a child I always had an argument with my mother about shopping. I can remember how upset I was if my mother didn't buy what I wanted and how much I cried. It was very ashameful for my mum. She was also very angry. Because she never managed to get me out from the toy shop.\n\nAs you see shopping is not always enjoyable.

But why should we read this book twice?\n\nFirstly, the story takes place in South Africa, during the period of the Appartheid. The political and historical background is very interesting, but also complicated. I think that you can't understand all the links between the events whitout reading the book more than one time. And by understanding the book, you'll also be able to better understand what happens nowadays in a lot of countries.\n\nHowever, I think that the main reason why someone has to read this book twice is the strength and depth of the two main characters: Donald Woods and Steve Biko. Both of them symbolize courage,  love of justice,  fight for freedom, which makes them look like heroes.

It was hard to choose only two. I've chosen tennis and sailing. I've played tennis since I was eight years old and I'm very good at it.

Even  I had planned something else to do I agreed because she's my very good friend.\n\nThe concert was due to start at 7 o'clock but we had to be there two hours before the beginning. First I was supposed to help at the refreshment spot for the fans but some 15 minutes before beginning I was told to go to the backstage and help with the refreshment for the musicians, technicians and others who worked there. It was very hectic there as everyone was a bit nervous but I saw the main stars and even managed to talk to them.\n\nWhen they started to play I was told to change my post again. This time I was helping the medical workers who had full hands with fainted teenage girls. First, it seemed to me odd because I didn't understand why they faint, but as the concert went on, the heat in the air was increasing and so was the number of the fainted. It wasn't funny anymore and I didn't know what to do first. I was really shocked by the view of crying and shaking but absolutely happy girls sitting or lying on the floor.\n\nHowever, I manage to listen  the music and I must admit that I liked it.

I recently had a week's holiday in London. During I stay I went to your theatre to see a musical show and unfortunatly I had a very disappointing evening.\n\nThe advertisement that you distributed through all the magazines wee totally untrue. Which so called \"Rip off\".\n\nFirst of all you said Danny Brook is in the play but  different actor was in the roll. It was just unbelievably disappointing because the reason I mean  main reason which made me to go was to see Danny Brook.\n\nSecondly about the time. If it's delayed you should have told us before. Not waiting there for almost 1 hour doing nothing. Due to  late start it finished at 1 AM and my taxi which I booked just left so I had to wait out side for another hour to get a taxi. It was freezing out side and I got  horrible cold for that.\n\nlastly about the ticket  advertisment saids 'Discouts Available' but no way I had to pad  full £ 20.00 and  restaurant was closed because of rebuilding  something. How ever the point that it am trying to say is  you just ruined my hoilday. For me, It's not easy to have  holiday and your play just blew my precious time away.\n\nLet me make it clear, you blew my time and money. I don't thing your play worth £ 20.00.\n\nYour advertisment was un fair. As you are a manager, you have resposbillity  to justify this problem. and I have  right to get a fair treatment as a costomer.\n\nSo therefore I would like you to pay some money back.

{"text": "Dear sir, I'm writing to express my complaint about the organization of the musical show I went to last Saturday evening. According to your advertisement, there should have been Danny Brook, starring  all the scenes. Instead, you changed  actor without any warning, so I didn't find my favourite Danny Brook, with my total disappointment, as his substitute couldn't catch him up at all. And what about the starting time? I had to wait for about an hour, as the show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30. Another thing that made me angry was that I couldn't have a discount. I was very annoyed about it: I only expected the discounts you had promised on the advertisement and, as I am a university student, I would have a right on it.

{"text": "Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. One minute I told her the biggest secret of my life, the next she had told someone all about it. I trusted her! How could I have been so stupid, so blind  not to see her disability to keep the biggest secret about my biggest crush ever?\n\nWhen I overheard girls from other forms gossiping about me and my latest crush, I was furious. I was seething. From that day onwards, Pat and I stopped being friends.\n\nI moved away that year, away to a whole new place and a whole new school. Once in a while my old schoolmates came and visited me and we had lots of fun together, just like the old times. However I felt I could not talk to them about the problems I was having, the one problem about my parents getting a divorce.\n\nWhen my parents told me the news, I was stunned, dazed. My dad began packing his things the very next day,  to his new apartment where he would live while waiting for the divorce papers and signing them. That period of my life was one of the worst. I went into a depression, and not matter who tried to make me feel better, I only felt worse.\n\nHowever, the person who helped me through this hard time was, surprisingly, Pat. She showed up on my doorstep just when I was having one of my worst days. She told me she heard about my parents' divorce and wanted to help. When she was comforting me I noticed she had changed. She was a person I could turn to, I could trust. She let me pour out my feelings, a thing I did not do to anyone. Ever since, she gained my trust and  told her my feelings and secrets. Unlike a year ago she did not tell a soul. She kept every single one of my secrets well, and not surprisingly, she became my best friend. Eventually, I got over my parents' divorce and lived like a normal, happy teenager.\n\nMy happiness was short lived. When I came home from school one day, I received a phone call from Pat's mum, and in a voice chocked with tears she told me that Pat had died in an accident. She had been killed by a speeding car.\n\nThe news shook me to the very core. I cried for days straight, eating and sleeping very little. I fell into a deep depression, and took an extremely long time to recover.\n\nI am still missing Pat, but my pain is nearly over now.

Secondly, the concerts took place in concert halls, which in my opinion were too small.

{"text": "Nowadays everybody wants to earn money. Young people know that money make the world go round, so they always look for a job with  big salary. Some people say that the young shouldn't be independent and earn on their own, but I am sure that it's better to work in your free-time than waste it. In my opinion the young should work rather than wait for their pocket money. There are a lot of possibilities  to earn some money but of course the young are not able to get  well-paid job, because they are not enough experienced and educated. They have to think about some season jobs. Firstly, the good way to earn money is, to help the old. They often are not able to do  shopping or walk the dog. If you help them, they may give you some money as a reward. Secondly, you can find an easy job in a shopping centre. It's better paid and  permanent job. You can work in storage, look after the goods or catch shoplifters. If you are  good mathematic you can be a seller.\n\nThirdly if you are good looking you can apply for a job in  restaurant and become  waiter. Maybe you'll not get a big salary but think about the tips, which in the posh restaurants are very high.\n\nLastly, if you like playing instruments and you don't like working you can go busking.

The concerts and the dance show were incredable, except for the classical concert that   halled to small.\n\nSecondly the plays and films were very good organized despide being  short number. I suggest  to do a couple more next year. The art exhibition and the talks by writers were great. The art exhibition showed us a new life style and society, it was totaly different from ours. The talks by writers were very tecnic but it could be understood by all the people who were in the festival\n\nIn conclusion, I am impresed on all the good organisation, the service and the cost of the weekend ticket for all events. The price has been excelent because there wasn't any limit of hours.\n\nI hope that you organice this festival for all the following years.\n\nYour Sincerely", "age": "16-20", "q": "1", "script-s": "29", "edits": [[0, [[88, 101, "Arts Festival", "RP"], [111, 111, ",", "MP"], [120, 184, "the number of stars and artists who came to the festival amazing", "W"], [199, 204, "were", "SX"], [284, 294, "incredible", "S"], [334, 334, "was in", "M"], [335, 351, "too small a hall", "W"], [362, 362, ",", "MP"], [393, 397, "well", "DY"], [408, 415, "despite", "S"], [416, 421, "", "UV"], [422, 422, "the", "MD"], [423, 428, "low", "RJ"], [429, 435, "numbers", "FN"], [447, 447, "you", "MA"], [448, 453, "organise", "RV"], [570, 580, "lifestyle", "RP"], [592, 593, "", "UP"], [594, 596, "that", "RA"], [601, 607, "totally", "DY"], [660, 666, "technical", "S"], [671, 673, "they", "AGA"], [721, 723, "at", "RT"], [736, 736, ".", "MP"], [755, 757, "was", "TV"], [758, 766, "impressed", "S"], [767, 769, "by", "RT"], [870, 878, "was", "TV"], [879, 887, "excellent", "S"], [913, 927, "time limit", "W"], [946, 954, "organise", "S"], [981, 990, "coming", "RJ"], [999, 1003, "Yours", "DA"]]]], "l1": "ca", "id": "TR857*0102*2000*02", "answer-s": "3.3"}

She is wonderful. But, first of all, let me explain to you what I did during the concert.\n\nWe arrived at the stadium the previous evening. The team of volunteers was a great one, and all of us were willing to help in anything they needed . Firstly, we were asked to clear the stadium, especially the seats and surroundings. When we finished clearing, some of us offered our help to enter the sound equipment into the stadium. They said that it wasn't necessary and we sat down on the grass and observed how the scenary was being prepared for the concert.\n\nAnd then, when all was prepared, Celine appeared in the scenary to make some sound tests. I was astonished. It was incredible! I was so near her! When she finished the tests, I went to meet her, I told her I was very happy for staying there and having helped at the concert, and I asked her  an authograph. She gave it to me with a great smile and gave permission to take a photograph of both of us. And she dedicated the photograph to me!\n\nI still believe it has only been a dream! I am willing to show you the authograph and the photograph.\n\nPlease, make sure you can come next weekend. We will be able to talk bout the concert and we will listen together to the last Celine Dion's C.D.\n\nLet me know if you are going to come so that I  prepare the bedroom to put you up .\n\nPlease, come!\n\nBest wishes,", "age": "26-30", "q": "4", "script-s": "33", "edits": [[0, [[301, 317, "evening before", "R"], [394, 396, "with", "RT"], [418, 418, "done", "MV"], [446, 451, "clean", "RV"], [521, 529, "cleaning", "RV"], [550, 553, "", "UD"], [554, 558, "to help", "R"], [562, 567, "bring", "RV"], [691, 698, "stage", "RN"], [751, 754, "everything", "RA"], [759, 767, "ready", "RJ"], [785, 787, "on", "RT"], [792, 799, "stage", "RN"], [803, 807, "do", "RV"], [808, 812, "a", "R"], [819, 824, "check", "RN"], [904, 909, "sound check", "RN"], [929, 930, ".", "RP"], [959, 962, "", "UT"], [963, 970, "to be", "RV"], [981, 987, "to have", "FV"], [1027, 1027, "for", "MT"], [1031, 1041, "autograph", "S"], [1248, 1258, "autograph", "S"], [1349, 1353, "about", "SX"], [1397, 1400, "", "UD"], [1401, 1424, "Celine Dion's last CD.", "W"], [1473, 1473, "can", "MV"], [1508, 1508, "in", "MT"]]]], "l1": "es", "id": "TR858*0100*2000*01", "answer-s": "4.2"}

It is known of all the lack of art festivals and cultural activities in general that shows our city. And what a belter thing to solve this than to give the festival an international character.\n\nBut including only six countries in the festival does not seem enough, in my opinion. I think next year you should invite more different countries, because the festival would be more multicultural.\n\nSecondly, there were some problems of accommodation in the classical concerts because some concert halls were too small. Another important thing is that, despite the number and quality of films, there were, from my point of view, not many plays. In addition, I would like to talk about the success among most visitors of the weekend ticket, due to its economical price and because of its comodity in use.\n\nFinally, I would like to suggest that, in next year's festival, you include different kinds of music, as ska or ethnical music.\n\nYours faithfully,", "age": "21-25", "q": "1", "script-s": "30", "edits": [[0, [[234, 238, "to", "RT"], [250, 252, "at", "RT"], [382, 384, "for", "RT"], [401, 500, "We all know that our city lacks art festivals and cultural activities in general", "AS"], [511, 512, "", "UD"], [513, 519, "better", "SX"], [520, 525, "way", "RN"], [722, 731, "", "UJ"], [820, 845, "accommodation problems", "W"], [1092, 1133, "of the weekend ticket with most visitors", "W"], [1182, 1190, "ease", "RN"], [1191, 1193, "of", "RT"], [1302, 1304, "like", "RT"], [1312, 1320, "world", "RJ"], [1335, 1345, "sincerely", "RY"]]]], "l1": "ca", "id": "TR862*0102*2000*02", "answer-s": "3.2"}

The topic says that young people have a lot of problems, but without any doubt, money is one of the most important of them.\n\nIf you still don't have economical freedom from your parents and your studies don't permit you to have a full-time job, these are some suggestions that maybe will help you.\n\nOne possible thing is to display in a public place what you can do best, and, then, \"sell\" it to the people. For example, you can   dance folk be Hamlet in the street, or even sing with some of your friends a nice song from you country. You must be aware, anyway, of the difficulty of this kind of things (bad weather, no attention from the people and so on)\n\nBut maybe you are too shy to do this. In this case, you can cook some cakes and sell them near a school or in the centre of the city, as well as other traditional products: cheese, honey ,chocolate...\n\nAnother thing that can be useful is to make some pottery or do original paintings and sculptures. You don't need to be a Picasso, it's enough with a bit of imagination.\n\nIf you don't feel like doing any thing of this, you have alternative solutions. If you like fishing, you can try to colaborate with the local market or some shops, in order to sell them the fish you can achieve by yourself.\n\nFinally, if anything of the above  result, you can prepare the classical parties in discos or work as a babysitter It doesn't matter how, the aim is always money.", "age": "21-25", "q": "2", "script-s": "30", "edits": [[0, [[37, 46, null, "R"], [186, 196, "financial", "RJ"], [197, 204, "independence", "RN"], [369, 407, "what you can do best in a public place", "W"], [466, 466, "do", "MV"], [467, 467, "a", "MD"], [468, 478, "folk dance", "W"], [478, 478, ",", "MP"], [479, 481, "do", "RV"], [517, 571, "a nice song from your country with some of your friends", "W"], [592, 598, "however", "RY"], [607, 617, "difficulties", "FN"], [618, 620, "with", "RT"], [621, 630, "these kinds", "AG"], [694, 694, ".", "MP"], [1026, 1027, ":", "RP"], [1028, 1065, "a bit of imagination is enough", "W"], [1101, 1114, "of these things", "AG"], [1184, 1194, "collaborate", "S"], [1267, 1270, "", "UV"], [1271, 1278, "catch", "RV"], [1279, 1281, "", "UT"], [1305, 1313, "none", "X"], [1327, 1327, "achieves a", "M"], [1340, 1343, "could", "TV"], [1344, 1351, "organise", "RV"], [1352, 1355, "", "UD"], [1356, 1365, null, "RJ"], [1407, 1407, ".", "MP"]]]], "l1": "ca", "id": "TR862*0102*2000*02", "answer-s": "4.3"}

It was a great idea, but I think I need to make some points about the things that I found unsatisfactory.\n\nFirst of all, I was disappointed that the artists invited were from only six countries. Next year's festival will be much better if artists from places other than Europe and the USA take part in it.\n\nSecondly, despite the high quality of the concerts, some of the halls they were given in were too small for the crowd of audition. They were cold and moist, too, because the air-conditioning system was insufficient.\n\nThirdly, I think more plays and films should be shown next year. However, I found the idea of a single ticket for all  events of the weekend excellent, as the price was reasonable and access to a wide range of events was provided.\n\nFinally, I should say that I had a very good time in spite of the flaws and I would like to thank you for it.

{"text": "Dec 16th, 2000\n\nDear Mary,\n\nI'm glad to have received your letter and I'd really like to talk about the school and family rules here.\n\nFirstly, the weirdest rule in our schools is that we must wear uniforms all the time. This is especially bad for us girls, as we are obliged to wear skirts and we cannot climb the stairs or run like the boys. But apart from this, I think most rules of the school are quite reasonable, like addressing to the teacher using the second plural person (it is different in Turkish) or standing up when s/he enters the class. As we are a developing country, teachers are quite respected.\n\nAnother thing  different from your schools is that we don't change classrooms between periods. We stay in the class in which we have been registered for the whole year, and a different teacher comes in every period.\n\nLet me talk about the rules at home. We like chatting on the phone so much that most of us' parents have limited the talking time down to five minutes, threatening to cut off the wires otherwise. Also, as most of us live in flats, we're not allowed to listen to loud music or run or play ball games in the house! But we are legally allowed to play instruments like the piano until 10 p.m.\n\nI'd love to write more, Mary, but I'm in a real rush nowadays.

I very enjoy on it, but some of the halls are too small. I saw that a lot of people were unsatisfied.\n\nAnother thing,  plays and films. I saw only 2 plays and 3 films. For me it is too little. One of the reasons that I have visited your art festival was to saw a lot of plays In  future I supposed to be an actress and that's way I want to learn something from  professionalists. I hoe that next year I will.\n\nThe last thing is that I was very surprised when I read that you have  weekend-price. This is  excellent idea because during the week people don't have too much time to go to the festival. Now they can visit it by  whole family at the weekend and see all events in  reasonaby-price\n\nI believe that you consider my opinions.

Unfortunately that evening wasn't as good as I expected.\n\nFirst of all in your advertisment for the show you wrote that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were taking part at the show. And I was so excited about it! But I was very disappointed when I realised that another actor was taking  part. And the worst  was that he wasn't so good in his role!\n\nAnother thing was that the show I went to was  starting at 19:30 but it started at 20:15! The people who were there to watch the show were very ungry and they were shouting because they  were waiting for too long, And I absolutely agree with them. Also in the advertisment you wrote that discounts were available, but they weren't, And also that people could visit the theatre restaurant after the show, to eat some thing or to have a drink.

{"text": "How has modern technology changed your daily life.\n\nWe are living in the 21st century where everybody is surrounded by advanced technological methods. As a result of all these advanced technological methods, I became one of the daily users of modern technology. Of course using modern technology has both advantages and disadvantages.\n\nThe first thing that came to my life and changed it completely is the computer. I spend most of my time in front of the computer, either working or playing. Of course this sometimes is an advantage, when for example the computer helps me to do my job easier, but some other times it is a great disadvantage because it keeps me away from my friends. But unfortunately I cannot live without a computer. The first thing I do in the morning is start up my computer, check if I have any new e-mails, check my electronic calendar and then go to work, where I always work with a computer. The computer has become my second nature.\n\nAnd  not only the computer. Everyday I use the microwave for heating my food and of course. I always carry with me my mobile phone. One of the greatest technological achievements and I am afraid to say that I cannot live without my mobile phone.\n\nIn conclusion I would like to say that modern technology is offering to the humanity to many things, some of them are good and some others are not so good.

The invention of cars planes, trains and other similar forms of transportation have enabled us to go from one place to another with no time. This enables us to save  great deal of time and effort. Quite recently, in my country electrical bicycles have been invented. This compared to the traditional bicycle is less physically painstaking and less time consuming and therefore lets me travel to my destination in  small amount of time with hardly no effort at all. This has made my life easier. On the other hand, I feel as though I am becoming lazier and exercising less.\n\nAnother significant technological developement is the creation of electrical appliances. There are many indispensable electrical appliances such as television, radio, fax machines, and microwaves. What changed my life most is portal computers. They are particularly useful for someone like me who travels often. Before I used computers generally, It took so much time for me to looking up words in a dictionary and looking up for information. With a computer however, all this is done in the matter of seconds. This again enables people to save time.\n\nThe modern technology helps people in many ways and is indespensible.

{"text": "Dear Kim,\n\nI really wish you were there with me at that one of the exciting nights in my life. Now I can't wait to tell you every detail. Are you ready?\n\nThat was a pop concert of Steps in  M.E.N Arena. And I was initially employed to be an entrance assistant whose job was to keep the queue under control as well as keeping the area clean.\n\nA few minutes after the concert began, a backstage assistant called in sick who was responsible for checking wether everything is going well according to the timetable, if something comes up, she should inform  other staff. I was then taken in to cover her job. I couldn't find my feet at first as I was so nervous. I was given lots of paper with many different time on it. I did manage to \"study\" them though, thanks to  other staff. They were very helpful and nice. They patiently explained to me my job even so they were fairly busy themselves. Then I found it was not as complicated as I though before. And I guess I did a good job as everything was getting on quite well.\n\nI saw all the members of the band backstage, how did they change their make-up, hairstyle etc. They were even talking jokes with me and other staff. I was impressed when they kept saying \"thank-you\" to the staff. Indeed, they can not succeed without their help, can they? I was lucky to have this chance and able to know how they work behind the scene.

It attracted a lot of people and they were really joyous after that.\n\nFinally, the reasonably price of the tickets for the weekend was a good point, because all kind of people an afford to buy it.

{"text": ",,Shopping is not always enjoyable\". From my point of view it is a very controversial issue, and we can't just easily claim whether it is enjoyable or not. It only depends on the person who is actually doing it and some convenient circumstances like a huge amount of money on our bank account. Some people don't like doing shopping at all and they can well explain to everyone why it isn't enjoyable. Luckily, I'm one of these people. First of all, shopping is a waste of time. People just run from one shop to another and they just can't decide what to buy. During the rush hour, shopping is almost impossible due to big queues in every single shop in the nearby area. I just can't understand people who with  smile on their faces spend their last money on unnecessary but expensive things. They are ready to sacrifise all their savings to get something that will make their neighbor jelous.\n\nSo, as a conlusion, I might say that shopping isn't enjoyable at all and I'd rather stay at home instead.", "age": "16-20", "q": "3", "script-s": "34", "edits": [[0, [[273, 275, "in", "RT"], [704, 704, ",", "MP"], [710, 710, "a", "MD"], [731, 731, ",", "MP"], [810, 819, "sacrifice", "S"], [876, 884, "neighbour", "SA"], [885, 891, "jealous", "S"], [903, 912, "conclusion", "S"]]]], "l1": "pl", "id": "TR941*0100*2000*01", "answer-s": "5.2"}

Personnaly speaking, I didn't saw it and even didn't heard of it: I have asked about it, but nobody seemed to know anything concerning discounts. On top of that, the restaurant was closed for renovations! How can you dare putting an advertisement for a theatre restaurant if you obviously know that is closed?

And we had to pay £20 each seat.\n\nThe worst was to come. The great Danny Brooks was supposed to be the main character. But, instead of him, we saw an unknown actor (who really need singing lessons).\n\nAfter the show we had planned to go to the theatre restaurant. But it was closed. Perhaps it was a  luck!\n\nSo we want you to give us our money back, the show didn't worth the price.\n\nYours faithfully,", "age": "26-30", "q": "1", "script-s": "30", "edits": [[0, [[5, 11, "Sir", "L"], [60, 62, "and", "R"], [250, 255, "fond", "SX"], [268, 281, "musicals", "RN"], [315, 322, "musicals", "AGN"], [577, 579, "from", "RT"], [664, 668, "a", "RD"], [818, 822, "needs", "AGV"], [941, 941, "stroke of", "M"], [1000, 1006, "wasn't", "RV"]]]], "l1": "fr", "id": "TR951*0102*2000*01", "answer-s": "5.1"}

The main characters of this book are Stephen Biko, a black leader, and Donald Woods who is a white newspaper editor. Woods is thought to stand for all of white peope and this book could have an influence on them.\n\nIn the first part of this book it can be seen  Woods is not on the side of the blacks although he didn't approve of the government's attitude to them. In some ways, he did not agree with \"Black Consciousness\" which is Biko's organization because it was too much against the whites. Woods thought he knew the black society quite well and understood their ordeals, but after he had met Biko and visited a black township, he realized he had been completely unaware of the way they had to live. The people and the circumstances he experienced in the black township were such a new world to him. Finally he changed his ideas and started to work for the blacks using his skill as a journalist, in other words, he became an activist for the black people of South Africa.\n\nAlthough Biko was killed and Woods himself was declared a banned person, I would dare to say their sacrifices were worthwhile because Woods succeeded in escaping from South Africa which would enable him to publish his book revealing the truth about South Africa to the world.\n\nIn short, Cry Freedom deserves to be recommended and once you read it, you will want to read it again.

I felt quite disappointed as everybody knows that \"our\" world is full of different cultures. Maybe not enough were represented.\n\nIn spite of the fact that the classical concerts were really good, I think that some concert halls were too small and so not everybody could appreciate the good quality of the music.\n\nI really enjoyed the plays and films, I wonder if there would be more next year? I hope so!\n\nFinally, I would like to tell you that the idea of one reasonably-priced ticket for the weekend is excellent, we can go where we want to, see what we feel like to.

{"text": "Dear Magda,\n\nThanks very much for your letter. As you asked me in it, here are some  school and home rules in my country, France.\n\nFirst of all, and I think it's a big difference with England, children don't wear uniforms at school. I was very surprised when I saw them in your country. It was a bit funny for me.\n\nOf course when you're in class you have to behave yourself, be polite with the teacher and the other school children. During the break too, usually some teachers stay out and keep an eye on you. I think nowadays, children are more free and heard, I mean  the contact between them and adults. Usually they know what they're allowed to do or not and if they don't respect it, the teacher not only punishes them ( not always) but also speaks with them.\n\nAt home  is different, each family has its own rules. As I am concerned, when I was a child, I was not allowed to stay  very late with my parents and sometimes I wanted to because I was not tired. But I was a wise child, so! Usually, at home, like at school, you have to behave yourself but differently, because you're at home so you feel more confident. There are some rules like \"don't speak with a full mouth\"; \"don't put your finger in your noise\"; \"say please and thank you\"; \"don't fight with your brother\"; and so on, but I think it's the same everywhere.\n\nWell, I hope I've helped you a little and I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nWith lots of love,", "age": "21-25", "q": "4", "script-s": "34", "edits": [[0, [[84, 84, "of the", "M"], [162, 183, "very different in", "R"], [373, 374, " and", "R"], [416, 431, "schoolchildren", "RP"], [450, 453, "", "UY"], [555, 560, null, "RJ"], [560, 561, ".", "RP"], [569, 569, "as regards", "MT"], [725, 725, "though", "MC"], [774, 774, "it", "MA"], [787, 793, ".

Internet is very handy, you can buy, send e-mail messages, or even have sex, that is really funny.\n\nThere is  ambiguity about technology -  can bring good things and terrible things as well. One good side is  making life easier - computer, mobile phones, vending machines, etc.... The bad side is   to use tecnology for war - missiles, weapons, etc....\n\nIndeed tecnology has changed our lives, we have become more scepitical and cold. I believe that people should take just good advantages that. Sometimes I think tecnology is not a good thing....", "age": "31-40", "q": "4", "script-s": "24", "edits": [[0, [[15, 27, "The twenty-first", "MD"], [90, 92, "", "UA"], [122, 133, "technology", "FN"], [161, 161, "was", "MV"], [167, 172, "in a time when there is", "R"], [183, 194, "technology", "FN"], [195, 199, "but", "R"], [270, 275, "this", "CD"], [276, 282, "stuff", "CN"], [283, 298, "mentioned above", "W"], [301, 310, "technology", "S"], [357, 361, "lives", "AGN"], [361, 367, ".

{"text": "For famous people, having a private life is difficult, especially because we are all interested in their lives.\n\nOn the one hand, I think that some famous people are looking for the media attention. Indeed, it can be useful for their career. The more they are in the media, the more they will be famous. According to me, some of them need to be appreciated by fans, they need to be loved and see themselves on television. However, some others only use the media to come back, because they cannot find a job anymore. They need to be famous again. Besides, I consider that some stars sometimes call journalist to tell them where they will be, in order to have free advertisement. Moreover, according to me, it is also a good way for them to earn money. Famous people are so often asked to give interview that the outcome is that they want to be paid for it, either in the newspapers or on television.\n\nOn the other hand, for other famous people, being followed by journalists is the worst element of the fame. In my opinion, it must be so stressful to endure the pressure they have to be perfect all the time because they could be followed by a photograph. They cannot go to public places, unless they make-up themselves and they are ready to sign autographs. They would really like a normal life, either because it is their temper, a regarding to their children. Nevertheless, they are never let alone, which is a shame.

{"text": "Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nThank you very much for the prize. I am writing this letter to inform you that I have recieved your letters and I am going to the trip.\n\nI would like to go to the trip in July because my school, which is Berkeley International School, is going to arrange the end of term break both for staff and students. Other reason is I think in July the weather is not so cold. The weather condition will be suitable for camping. I prefer to live in tents to log cabin because sleeping in the tent makes me more comfortable and I can get closer to the nature. Every night I would like to come out of the small tent to the nice enviroment outside the tent. Although, living in the tent is more comfortable. I'll have to be aware about insects so I've bought so many insects repellant. I can choose to do 2 activities so I would like to play tennis and  swimming. When I was in  fourth form, I got the first prize in  swimming competition and third prize in tennis. I was a bit disapotted with the result because I was expected to win the first prize or secound price.\n\nLastly, I would like to ask you  questions. First, how many clothes do I have to bring?

The aim of this report is to inform my teacher about them. Here are my findings.\n\nBest lessons to film\n\nAs all the students are different from each other, it is essential to show many aspects of the school. Therefore, to show the good aspects, I suggest to film Mr. Clark's English classes, because they are highly educative and because the students participate a lot. On the other hand, to show less pleasing aspects, it would be adequate to film Mrs. Morrison's French classes, as they are extremely boring and sub-standard.\n\nInteresting activities\n\nOne event that should not be missed to film, is the weekly football game between teachers and students, which shows how well they get along with each other. Another event that should absolutely be captured on film is the preparation of the meals in the canteen. The cooks are very friendly and excellent.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, I suggest that our English class seriously takes into consideration my suggestions when making the video.

I must tell you that helping at pop concerts is very exciting, but very tiring too, so I had to rest.\n\nYou asked me about my experiences. Well, it was the best time of my life! I worked all days, but I did it with pleasure. We lived here in rush, but there was a lot of fun, too. I was very surprised, when I saw that singers aren't so sophisticated and self-confident as they are written in the newspapers.\n\nOne day I was talking to Stenkovska, because I had to go to buy something to eat for everyone, so I should ask her what did she want. When she tried to answear me, one small child made her a picture with  flesh. Imagine, she weren't angry! She said he should do it again, because she had stupid features! If I were she, I would kill that boy, but she was nice!\n\nTrully, my work here wasn't very important, but I relly enjoyed it. I've met here so many new people! Sometimes somebody should on me, but I have to say they are often right. Well, I made  couple  mistakes. The hardest was, when I brought a pepperoni pizza for kubulska, but she doesn't eat meat!\n\nBut, for luck, it wasn't achieved with succes of our concert. You have to admit, that the show was magnificent. I hope you had a great fun when you was watching us at the TV set, didn't you?\n\nO.K. That's all for today. I'll write  you again tomorrow, because now my Mom is angry, the I'am not sleeping yet. Write soon! I can't hardly wait.

{"text": "I agree with this statement.\n\nI think that famous people deserve to have a private life like all the normal people, without journalists following them all the time.\n\nA famous person should have the chance to go on his own for a walk without having the annoying impression of being followed.\n\nIn my opinion the journalists should have more respect for the private life of the famous people. They should understand when it is too much, when they are going too far.\n\nFor instance, the tragic death of Princess Diana is an example of what a journalist must not do. In this occasion we can say that the journalists have, of course indirectly, caused her death.\n\nOn the other hand, the famous people have to understand that the people are interested in their lives. If one is famous it has to accept also the disadvantages of be famous.\n\nThe famous people must enderstand that the journalists are doing their work.\n\nIn my view Prince Charles is a good example of how famous people have to deal with the media. When he goes skiing in Switzerland he always stops for a while to talk with the journalists and to give the photographers the chance to take pictures. After this break he continues to ski without be annoyed for the rest of the holiday.\n\nIn conclusion I think that there must be more compehension and respect between famous people and the media.", "age": "21-25", "q": "2", "script-s": "35", "edits": [[0, [[363, 367, "lives", "FN"], [371, 374, "", "UD"], [569, 577, "instance", "RN"], [676, 679, "", "UD"], [718, 721, "", "UD"], [776, 776, ",", "MP"], [777, 779, "one", "RA"], [820, 822, "being", "FV"], [832, 842, "Famous", "UD"], [855, 865, "understand", "S"], [903, 907, "job", "RN"], [1200, 1202, "being", "FV"], [1287, 1299, "understanding", "RN"]]]], "l1": "it", "id": "TR1061*0100*2000*02", "answer-s": "5.2"}

I am very sensitive to noise especially at night and tend to catch a cold even in summer.\n\nAnd I love to learn surfing and painting. I am quite good at swimming but I never tried to do surfing. So this time I am really keen on learning that. I also love painting. I expect you have lovely nature in California for me to draw on my canvas.\n\nLet me ask a question about clothes and money.

{"text": "Shopping is not always enjoyable\n\nI love shopping. But I can't help accepting it is true that shopping is not always enjoyable.\n\nFor example, any shops are too busy to enjoy shopping in at weekends. Sometimes customers' trolleys run into each other and they have to wait ages to go through check-ins. What's worse, there is usually  traffic jam around or along roads to a big supermarket and a shopping mall. And if an accident takes place on the roads, it can be a nightmare. So I prefer shopping at weekdays unless I am busy or have an appointment.\n\nHowever, people can't have a good time even at weekdays while shopping. Shopping gets them tired as they have to walk for a long time to find the things they want to get. In addition, they can get angry with a shop assistant because of bad service.\n\nFor the handicapped, going shopping is not easy and it can be very bothering unless shops have facilities for them.\n\nDespite all these things which show that shopping is not always enjoyable, people have to go shopping.

I have to say that I am realy disappointed bout your advertisement because you mentioned some points that are not true.\n\nFirstly I'd like to complain about the actor of the show. On your advertisement you say that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove are starring in the play but I am sure that they never appear on the stage that night. Secondly another ploblem was about the starting time, according to your advertisement the play starts at 19.30 and instead it started on 20:15, this is about almost an hour delay. Moreover, there were several prices about the tickets and an available discount, Something that wasn't true. We didn't get any discount. Furthermore On your advertisement you say that visitors can visit the theatre restaurant after the play, but the restaurant was closed and I'd like to know why. I am very disappointed about the whole situation and I am not happy  to ask for a money refund.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.", "age": "16-20", "q": "1", "script-s": "28", "edits": [[0, [[20, 27, "Manager", "RP"], [42, 49, "Theatre", "RP"], [57, 69, "Sir or Madam", "RP"], [92, 106, "concerning", "RT"], [126, 131, "for", "RT"], [141, 143, "at", "RT"], [188, 193, "really", "DY"], [207, 211, "with", "RT"], [243, 252, null, "RV"], [324, 329, "actors", "FN"], [330, 332, "in", "RT"], [343, 345, "In", "RT"], [463, 469, "appeared", "TV"], [503, 503, ",", "MP"], [512, 519, "problem", "S"], [524, 529, "", "UT"], [547, 558, ".

But I did not mind anymore because I knew that a show with Danny Brook would be worth this. That was why I was really shocked recognizing that there was another actor playing . This actor was not almost as brilliant as Danny Brook and I would not have paied so many money if I had known this before. At the end of the musical I decided to \"rescue\" this evening by visiting your theatre restaurant. Like everything   had gone wrong that evening, the restaurant was closed because the cook had fallen ill! I hope you can see that this was no \"perfect evening\" and I was very disappointed, mostly because this was the last night of our stay in London.

Well, I would not agree that this statement is always true, but it is true in the case of the book \"The Old Man and the Sea\" by Ernest Hemingway.\n\nThe context of the book is easy to understand and not very spectacular: an old fisherman is alone on the vast sea, fighting with a strong fish he had caught. What makes the situation difficult is that none of the two characters wants to give up. It becomes a fight about life or death.\n\nThe excitement is not created by bloody fights but by the strength of the protagonist. He is old and he wants to win this last competition between him and the nature. So he bares everything: the days and nights on the sea, without any food or water, the terrible summer sun, the being injured from keeping  to the line where the fish is on.\n\nThe reader feels with him, wants to know if he will win or wonders why he will not give up.\n\nAlthough this situation might not  very difficult or important for anybody else, it is for this old man and I found it very exciting to follow this story until it's quiet, sad end.

I thought it was a great opportunity to see how things turn out so well when you put everybody's different talents together.

They write their secret notes into the computers. Computers hold them in their memory.

Mr White came to our school when he was 40 year-old but still well-looking and all my girls school-mates fell suddenly in love with him; he was always so kind and generous towards his pupils that any girls felt herself loved by him: Pat certainly was one of them. One day while she was walking in Central Park she saw a man and a young girl sitting under a tree. Immediately she recognized her beloved teacher kissing one of her class mate and she run away as fast as she could. She was so angry and felt so betrayed by Mr White that without any exitation she went to the school Headmaster to report everything she had seen. The next day Mr White was charged for abuses and obliged to resign. The trial was long and had a wide coverage by  media. We live in a small and old fashioned town and Mr. White was considered a monster: loosing his job was hard for him, but even harder was the loss of his beloved pupils who were not allowed to meet him; so, on a bright summer day he took his final decision and died terrified by the darkness which was nearing.", "age": "21-25", "q": "2", "script-s": "34", "edits": [[0, [[82, 90, "reason for", "RN"], [153, 162, "teenager", "UP"], [191, 194, "", "UD"], [225, 233, "problems", "RN"], [318, 328, "never have", "W"], [409, 417, "years old", "AGN"], [428, 440, "good-looking", "RJ"], [452, 457, "female", "R"], [566, 571, "girl", "AGN"], [795, 805, "classmates", "AGN"], [814, 817, "ran", "TV"], [912, 921, "hesitation", "DN"], [1025, 1028, "with", "RT"], [1029, 1035, "abuse", "FN"], [1082, 1085, "received", "RV"], [1086, 1087, "", "UD"], [1102, 1104, "from", "RT"], [1105, 1105, "the", "MD"], [1136, 1149, "old-fashioned", "MP"], [1195, 1202, "losing", "RV"], [1376, 1376, ",", "MP"]]]], "l1": "it", "id": "TR1140*0102*2000*01", "answer-s": "4.3"}
